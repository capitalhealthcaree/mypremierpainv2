              A migraine goes beyond a headache. A debilitating, throbbing,
              one-sided headache might keep you in bed for days. Movement,
              lights, sounds, and other stimuli might produce weariness, nausea,
              visual problems, irritability, and more. A migraine specialist can
              help you control migraines so they don't take over.

            <h2>How do Diagnose Migraines?</h2>
            <p>
              In cases that are unusual, complex, or sudden, tests may be
              necessary to rule out alternative causes of pain.
            </p>
            <li>
              MRI: MRI scans employ radio waves and a high magnetic field to
              create comprehensive brain and blood vessel pictures. MRI scans
              can diagnose neurological diseases such as tumors, strokes, brain
              hemorrhages, infections, and others.
            </li>
            <li>
              CT scan: A computed tomography (CT) scan creates brain
              cross-sections from X-rays. This detects cancer, infections, brain
              injury, brain hemorrhage, and other causes of headaches.
            </li>
            <h2>Management and Treatments</h2>
            <p>
              Chronic migraine medications are similar to other migraine
              treatments. There are two primary forms of therapy:
            </p>
            <li>Preventive: Medicines prevent or reduce migraines.</li>
            <li>
              Rescue: These drugs “rescue” migraines by shortening and reducing
              their severity.
            </li>
            <p>
              Medical treatments offered by Premier Pain Centers help treat
              persistent migraines. Treatment options also include mental
              healthcare.
            </p>
            <h3>Triptan Drugs</h3>
            <p>
              These migraine treatments are usually first-line. Commonly used
              medicines include:
            </p>
            <li>Frovatriptan</li>
            <li>Naratriptan (Amerge)</li>
            <li>Rizatriptan (Maxalt)</li>
            <li>Intrex or Onzetra sumatriptan</li>
            <li>Ergotamine</li>
            <p>
              This medicine narrows brain blood vessels and alters pain signal
              processing. Ergomar is a name-brand ergotamine. These medications
              contain an NSAID plus a barbiturate or opioid painkiller. People
              rarely go for chronic migraine treatments in Dallas because they
              exacerbate the condition, but a good physician can handle the
              situation. Psychotherapy can treat stress and anxiety, which cause
              migraines. Psychotherapy comes in numerous forms, so you can find
              one that works for you.
            </p>
            <h3>Manage Stress</h3>
            <li>
              Stress and migraines often occur together. No one can avoid daily
              stress, but you can manage it to reduce migraines. Stress can
              cause migraines in teens, especially.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simplify life. Avoid adding activities or chores to the day. Find
              ways to leave stuff out.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use your time wisely. Work and home to-do lists should be updated
              daily. Delegate and break down large projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rest. If you're overwhelmed, leisurely stretches or a brisk walk
              might re-energize you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Change your mindset. Be optimistic. If you believe that this is
              impossible, change your perspective. Think, "It'll be hard. But I
              can manage."
            </li>
            <li>
              Have fun. Give yourself 15 minutes to do something you like every
              day. It might be a game, coffee with a friend, or a pastime. Doing
              what you like reduces stress naturally.
            </li>
            <h3>Eat Well</h3>
            <p>Diet can affect migraines. Consider fundamentals:</p>
            <li>
              Maintain consistency. You should eat at the same time every day.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid skipping meals. Fasting raises the risk of migraines.</li>
            <li>
              Keep food logs. Tracking your diet and migraines might help you
              uncover dietary triggers. Intake of a good amount of magnesium for
              migraine is a very good approach.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid migraine-causing foods. Remove a suspected migraine trigger
              from your diet to observe what occurs. Aged cheese, chocolate,
              coffee, and alcohol are examples.
            </li>
            <h3>Keep Yourself in Peace</h3>
            <p>
              If you can, stop when a migraine starts. Turn off the lights. Both
              light and sound can worsen migraines. Relax in a dark, quiet room.
              If possible, sleep. Try temperature therapy. Hot or cold, compress
              your head or neck. Numbing ice packs may reduce discomfort.
              Heating pads and hot packs relieve tension. Warm showers or baths
              may work similarly. Drink caffeine. In tiny amounts, coffee alone
              can ease early migraine discomfort. Caffeine may boost the
              pain-relieving effects of acetaminophen and aspirin.
            </p>
            <h3>Surgery for Migraines</h3>
            <p>
              Some migraine sufferers get surgery when other therapies fail.
              This method is controversial and unstudied. Except in research
              studies, the American Headache Society doesn't endorse surgery.
              There are two main migraine surgeries:
            </p>
            <li>
              Nerve decompression{" "}
              <Link href="/contact-locations/fort-worth/" rel="preload">
                Migraine surgery in Fort Worth
              </Link>{" "}
              is used to decompress nerves. During this procedure, a surgeon
              removes tissue that presses on migraine-triggering nerves.
            </li>
            <li>Neurectomy. Cut the nerve end where your agony begins.</li>
            <p>
              Other medical treatments, like botox for migraine are very
              beneficial. And cognitive-behavioral treatment for migraine, in
              which therapists can teach you how thoughts and actions affect
              pain perception. They can also teach you stress-reduction
              techniques to prevent migraines.
            </p>
            <h2>Is it Possible to Prevent or Reduce Chronic Migraines?</h2>
            <p>
              Chronic migraine's cause is unknown to experts. That makes it
              impossible to prevent 100%. Some people can prevent chronic
              migraine, but those with a familial history may develop it. If you
              have episodic migraine, the only way to lower your risk of chronic
              migraine is to lessen the likelihood that your drugs may cause it.
              Your

              can provide guidance on medication use and transformation
              prevention.

            <h2>When to Call a Doctor</h2>
            <p>
              Consult a doctor at Dallas Emergency Care for Migraines if a
              headache persists. Seek medical attention immediately if you have
              a strong headache. The symptoms include:{" "}
