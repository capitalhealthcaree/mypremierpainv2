            <h4>Spinal cord stimulation?</h4>
            <p>
              When an injury lasts longer than expected, the body responds
              inappropriately and develops chronic pain. When chronic pain
              ceases to protect the body from injury, it becomes harmful by
              itself and on its own. Chronic pain can also cause psychological
              disorders and impair the ability to work, eat, exercise, or pursue
              other daily activities. Aside from chronic pain, patients may also
              experience depression, weight gain, medication overuse, fatigue,
              and other chronic health conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is believed that nerve signals are continuously transmitted
              throughout the body to the brain. This prevents injuries by
              notifying the individual of possible problems. When nerves are
              damaged, pain signals can be sent to the brain even without
              physical injury. It is possible to disrupt these signals by
              stimulating the spinal cord.{" "}

            <h2>A Spinal Cord Stimulator</h2>
            <p>
              The SCS device delivers mild electric currents to the spinal cord
              through a pulse generator, implanted under the skin. The pulse
              generator transmits current through thin wires to nerve fibers
              within the spinal cord. As a result of the modification and
              masking of the pain signal by electrical pulses, a SCS reduces
              pain in an area where you are experiencing pain.{" "}

              comprehensive treatment and diagnosis guidelines.Spinal cord
              stimulator is applied in two stages.
            </p>
            <h4>1- Trail Stage</h4>
            <p>
              During the trial stage, leads are temporarily inserted through
              needles to assess the effectiveness of the device. This is done to
              determine if tingling is comfortable for you. You will be able to
              test your implant at home approximately one week after the
              procedure.
            </p>
            <h4>2- Final Stage</h4>
            <p>
              If you experience a positive experience with the stimulator, you
              may need a second procedure to permanently implant it. In most
              cases, this minor surgical procedure is performed outpatient.
              Depending on your specific circumstances, your physician may
              recommend you stay overnight in the hospital. It is necessary to
              follow the following steps in preparation for both procedures:
            </p>
            <li>
              After the procedure, you will not be able to drive or operate
              machinery for at least 24 hours, so please arrange for someone to
              drive you home.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not consume any food or drink after midnight the night before
              the procedure if you require medication.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your insulin dosage may need to be adjusted on the day of the
              procedure, depending on the type of diabetes medication you are
              taking. If you require an adjustment to your insulin or diabetes
              medication, please consult with your physician. After the
              procedure, remember to take your diabetes medication.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must obtain your physician's permission before discontinuing
              blood thinners and antiplatelet medications.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are taking any other medications, you should drink a small
              amount of water while you are taking them.
            </li>
            <p>
              Consult your primary care physician or a referring physician
              before discontinuing any medications. Make sure that you bring all
              of your medications with you to the procedure so that they may be
              taken afterward.

            <h2>What Happens During Surgery?</h2>
            <p>
              The average surgical procedure lasts between one and two hours.
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Step 1: Prepare The Patient:</b> As you lie on the table lying
              on your stomach, a light anesthesia will be administered to you. A
              lead and generator are then implanted in your back and buttocks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Step 2: Attach The Leads:</b> Electrode leads are inserted
              using fluoroscopy (X-ray). To expose the bony vertebra of your
              back, a small incision is made in the middle of your back. As a
              result of the laminotomy, an area of the bony arch is removed in
              order to accommodate the leads. Epidural leads are placed above
              the spinal cord and stitched in place. Your spinal cord is not
              directly affected by the leads.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Step 3: Conduct a Stimulation Test (Optional):</b> Depending on
              the type of SCS device being implanted, you may need to be
              awakened to test how well it covers the painful areas. Upon
              completion of surgery, the pulse generator will be programmed
              based on the trial settings. Modern SCS devices can also be
              positioned based on anatomical characteristics or electrical nerve
              monitoring. The feedback you provide is extremely valuable in
              ensuring pain relief is as effective as possible. Implanted leads
              may not require repositioning or replacement during the trial.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Step 5. Put The Pulse Generator In Place:</b> In order to
              perform this procedure, the surgeon makes a small incision below
              the waistline. Under the skin, a pocket is created to accommodate
              the generator. Lead wires connect pulse generators to pockets
              containing lead wires.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Step 6. Close The Incisions:</b> Closure of the incisions is
              achieved by using sutures and skin glue. Afterwards, a dressing is
              applied.
            </li>

              are rarely associated with complications or serious side effects.
              Patients typically experience pain for a few days following
              insertion. If the pain persists beyond a few days, you may be
              prescribed pain medication to alleviate the discomfort until it
              subsides. Other complications during the procedure include
              infection, bleeding, nerve damage, spinal cord injury, a dural
              puncture or tear, wire migration or breakage, and others. A
              patient can usually resume moderate activity several days after
              having undergone the procedure. Patients are advised not to lift,
              bend, or twist for at least two months after surgery so that the
              leads can heal in the appropriate position without moving. Medical
