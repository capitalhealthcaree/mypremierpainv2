              Various medications, including opioids, can be used to manage
              pain. The use of these drugs is associated with numerous risks and
              side effects, including the possibility of abuse or addiction.
              Peripheral nerve stimulation has become increasingly popular as a
              treatment option for a variety of conditions, including persistent{" "}

              Comparatively to opioid painkillers, PNS technology provides
              better results, lasts longer, and does not pose a dependence risk.

            <h2>Peripheral Nerve Stimulation: What Is It?</h2>
            <p>
              Your pain has been treated with ineffective or marginally
              effective treatments in the majority of cases. Surgical procedures
              such as this target a nerve or several nerves that transmit most
              of the pain. You experience pain due to the introduction of an
              electrical current to these nerves. A hallmark of this procedure
              is its reversibility and non-destructive nature.
            </p>
            <h2>Indications</h2>
            <p>
              Peripheral nerve stimulation may be recommended by your physician
              if your pain has become chronic and medication and therapy have
              not relieved it. Peripheral nerve stimulation is effective in
              treating a variety of painful conditions, including:
            </p>
            <li>Occipital neuralgia (a rare chronic headache disorder).</li>

            <h2> Trial & Procedure</h2>
            <p>
              Before a permanent implant is placed, a trial implant will be
              placed to ensure that it will yield the desired results. Once this
              procedure has been successfully completed, a permanent implant
              will be placed. A neurostimulator implantable under the skin is a
              small device that is capable of stimulating the brain. To turn on
              or off the device, you will be provided with a remote control.
            </p>
            <p>
              When pain flares up, the device emits a tiny electrical signal to
              disrupt nerve signals. While some patients are concerned that
              electrical signals will be released during this procedure, many
              have successfully undergone this procedure. PNS has a high success
              rate and provides immediate results. Sometimes, the device may not
              function correctly and may need to be removed. The process of
              achieving this can be very easily accomplished. Due to the
              implant's placement just beneath the skin, the implant is
              minimally invasive.
            </p>
            <h2>Surgical Procedure</h2>
            <p>Peripheral nerve stimulation consists of two steps:</p>
            <h3>Step 1 (Electrode Implantation)</h3>
            <li>
              This first step involves undergoing a trial period in order to
              determine whether the treatment is effective in treating your
              chronic pain. The device is being installed for the first time
              before it becomes permanent. The purpose of this procedure is to
              control pain by placing an electrode in close proximity to
              peripheral nerves.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to numb the insertion site, you will lie down on the
              procedure table and be given anesthesia.
            </li>
            <li>Incisions will be made in a small area.</li>
            <li>
              This procedure involves inserting an electrode (wire) through the
              incision and attaching it to the targeted nerve.
            </li>
            <li>
              An external stimulator produces impulses by connecting the
              electrode wires to the stimulator.
            </li>
            <li>
              A recovery room will be available to you after the electrodes have
              been inserted and you will be able to return home the following
              day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Typically, the trial takes about one week to complete. Once you
              are satisfied with the results and there has been significant pain
              relief, the second step will be performed. In addition to
              providing pain relief, this trial also allows your doctor to
              determine the appropriate level of stimulation to be used.
            </li>
            <h3>Step 2 (Battery Insertion)</h3>
            <li>
              This step will follow a successful trial within a few days or
              weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
              A general anesthetic will be used for this procedure, and
              temporary external wires will be removed following the procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to deliver stimulation, wires are run under the skin from
              the electrodes to a battery-operated internal stimulator that is
              implanted under the skin. The most common placement of internal
              stimulators is in the buttocks, under the arms, or along the chest
              walls.
            </li>
            <h2>What happens After Implantation Of The Permanent System</h2>
            <li>
              Upon completion of the second stage of your operation, you should
              be able to be discharged from the hospital within 1-2 days.
            </li>
            <li>
              A four-day period following your discharge from the hospital is
              recommended for your doctor to examine your wounds.

              The six weeks following surgery should be spent resting. A daily
              exercise program of one hour, such as walking, is recommended.
            </li>
            <li>
              A physician should be consulted prior to signing or witnessing any
              legal documents. After six to eight weeks, a{" "}

              orthopedic surgeon or pain specialist will review your condition.
              With a few weeks, you should be able to operate a motor vehicle
              without experiencing any discomfort.

              What Is The Effectiveness Of Peripheral Nerve Stimulation In
              Treating Pain?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Peripheral nerve stimulation is beneficial to approximately 70% of
              patients who are selected for treatment. The rate at which pain is
              reduced varies from patient to patient. Overall, pain scores are
              reduced by 50%. When a patient has a pain score of 10/10, for
              example, the pain score may be reduced to 5/10. In order to
