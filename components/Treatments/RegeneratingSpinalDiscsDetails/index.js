            <h2>WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT</h2>
            <h4>Regenerating Spinal Discs Treatment</h4>
            <p>
              Most people develop degenerated discs as they age, and
              degenerative disc disease is not really a disease. There is often
              pain and numbness associated with disc leaks. A leak does not
              result in symptoms if there is no leak. An annular tear is the
              cause of almost all degenerative discs. In time, the tear
              progresses to multiple disc tears, which eventually results in
              degenerative disc disease. Degenerative disc disease is common in
              people over 60, according to MRI and CT studies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spinal conditions, such as degenerative disc disease, are
              increasingly treated with biologics, such as stem cells and
              platelets-rich plasma. There have been several treatment tools
              available over the years for degenerative disc disease, the
              leading cause of lower back pain . These conservative nonsurgical
              interventions often relieve symptoms effectively. Lumbar fusion
              surgery is sometimes necessary when conventional methods aren't
              effective. A new treatment option for chronic discogenic back pain
              is regenerating spinal discs richardson.
