            <h4>Epidural Nerve Block</h4>
            <p>
              Epidural space refers to the fat-filled space surrounding the
              spinal cord. As a result, damage to the spinal cord and the nerves
              surrounding the spinal cord is prevented The purpose of this type
              of anesthesia is to numb the spinal nerves and prevent pain
              signals from being transmitted to the brain during surgery. It
              usually takes between 10 and 20 minutes for it to take effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              A catheter is used to administer nerve blocks. As a result of this
              tube being positioned near your spine, you will not experience any
              pain during your surgery, since the medicine will be delivered
              nonstop. Medicine is injected into the epidural space using
              syringes. The causes of pain can vary, but{" "}

            <h2>How Epidural Steroid Injection Reduces My Pain?</h2>
            <li>
              When cortisone is injected into the epidural space, it has a
              profound anti-inflammatory effect that leads to a decrease in pain
              and an improvement in function.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              The use of steroids accelerates the healing process of the
              underlying condition without causing pain or inflammation.
              Degenerated or disrupted discs are fortunate to be able to heal
              without surgery, just like any other body tissue.
            </li>
            <li>
              A comprehensive rehabilitation plan and certain precautions can be
              combined with injections to provide benefits that will outlast the
              use of steroids.

              understands the impact of pain on the quality of life of our
              patients. An epidural can be administered in a variety of ways by
              your healthcare provider, including:{" "}

            <li>
              <b>Single-injection Epidural:</b> A single epidural steroid
              injection is the most common type of epidural steroid injection.
              This type of injection frequently results in numbness in the area
              after the injection. For short-term pain relief, epidural
              anesthesia is administered as a single injection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Epidural with a Catheter:</b> Epidural procedures typically
              involve placing a catheter in your epidural space so that you can
              receive a continuous flow of anesthetic medication, multiple doses
              or both during the procedure. Epidurals of this type are typically
              prescribed for long-term operations, pain relief over a period of
              several days, and labor and childbirth.

              controls the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Based on
              your age, weight, and the type of surgery you underwent, these
              controls are programmed to administer the pain-relieving
              medication your provider orders. PCA pumps are operated by
              pressing a button when you feel pain. If you have not yet received
              another dose, the pump will not administer medication.

            <h2>Procedure For Epidural Steroid Injection</h2>
            <p>
              The use of epidural steroids injections is often used in the
              management or treatment of chronic pain. The epidural can be
              injected anywhere along your spine, depending on what is causing
              your pain. An epidural steroid injection procedure generally
              involves the following steps:
            </p>
            <li>
              Local anesthesia will be injected using a small needle near the
              area where the epidural will be inserted. As a result, you will
              experience less pain when the epidural needle is inserted, which
              is bigger than a standard injection needle.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the epidural procedure, your provider is likely to use an
              imaging device, such as a fluoroscopy or CT scanner (both are
              radiology imaging devices) to help guide the needle precisely
              where it should be placed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Following the insertion of the epidural needle, your provider will
              inject contrast material into the epidural space surrounding your
              spinal cord.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using contrast material will allow your{" "}
              <Link href="/meet-our-team/rao-k-ali/" rel="preload">

              to see the area they are focusing on on the imaging machine's
              screen more clearly.
            </li>
            <li>
              By doing so, the medication is more likely to reach the inflamed
              nerves that need to be treated.
            </li>
            <li>
              The healthcare provider will slowly inject a steroid or
              corticosteroid into your body. Providers may mix corticosteroids
              with long-acting anesthetics when injecting.
            </li>
            <h2>How Do You Expect The Results To Turn Out?</h2>
            <p>
              The use of ESI can be effective and safe for the treatment of
              pain. During the first or second day following the procedure, you
              may feel sore. Taking it easy the day of the procedure is
              recommended, but you can resume your normal activities the
              following day. Injections are administered two days before the
              procedure to provide benefits. Our goal at{" "}

              is to assist individuals in restoring their health by providing
              comprehensive treatment and diagnosis guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the fact that injections do not treat the underlying
              condition, they can interrupt the cycle of pain and inflammation,
              allowing you to heal. To maximize the benefits of these injections
              and prolong their pain-relieving effects, these injections are
              usually administered alongside other treatments such as physical
              therapy. The benefits of injections can, therefore, last for a
              long time beyond the duration of the treatment.{" "}
