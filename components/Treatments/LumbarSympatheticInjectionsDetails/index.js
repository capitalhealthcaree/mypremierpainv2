            <h2>ARE LUMBAR SYMPATHETIC INJECTIONS SAFE FOR YOU?</h2>
            <p>
              By injecting sympathetic nerves into the lumbar spine, leg and
              foot pain can be temporarily alleviated. Furthermore, it regulates
              other bodily functions, including sweating and blood circulation.
              The block may be beneficial for a variety of conditions, including
              complex regional pain syndrome, phantom limb pain, and
              hyperhidrosis.{" "}

            <h2>What are Lumbar Sympathetic Injections?</h2>
            <p>
              As part of the sympathetic nervous system, sympathetic nerves
              regulate blood pressure, temperature, blood flow, and other
              functions. An unnecessarily stimulated sympathetic nerve may
              result in constricting blood vessels and poor blood circulation to
              the affected limb. A damaged sympathetic nerve in your lower back
              may cause pain and weakness in your lower extremities
            </p>
            <p>
              For conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome or shingles,
              spinal sympathetic injections are a relatively common treatment
              option. Sympathetic nerve injections are used to determine whether
              sympathetic nerves are responsible for{" "}

            <h2>Who is a Candidate?</h2>
            <p>
              If you suffer chronic pain from any of the following conditions, a
              sympathetic nerve block may be of benefit to you:
            </p>
            <li>Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (CRPS-1)</li>
            <li>CRS Type 2 (causalgia)</li>
            <li>
              Leg vascular insufficiency due to blockages in small vessels
            </li>
            <li>A pain in the Phantom Limb</li>
            <li>Legs affected by herpes zoster (shingles)</li>
            <li>
              Diabetic neuropathy causing pain in the legs that cannot be
              relieved by medication
            </li>
            <h2>When Should You Avoid This Procedure?</h2>
            <p>
              Lumbar sympathetic blocks can be used for diagnostic and
              therapeutic purposes. But, if you are suffering from bleeding or
              infection, you should not undergo this procedure. If you are
              diabetic, corticosteroids may temporarily raise your blood sugar.
              Glaucoma patients may also experience temporary elevations in
              blood pressure or eye pressure. You should consult your physician
              regarding this condition. Consult your physician if you believe
              you may be pregnant or are trying to conceive. The use of
              fluoroscopy (x-rays) during pregnancy may result in harm to the
              fetus.
            </p>
            <h2>What Happens During A Lumbar Sympathetic Nerve Block?</h2>
            <p>
              Find out what to expect from your healthcare provider. You may
              need to follow a different procedure. A lumbar sympathetic nerve
              block generally involves the following steps:
            </p>
            <li>
              The procedure will be performed on a table with you lying on your
              stomach.
            </li>
            <li>
              The doctor may prescribe medicine to help you relax (sedation).
              During the procedure, you are likely to remain awake.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will be monitored closely during the procedure regarding your
              heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen level. With the help of a
              mask or nasal tube, you may be able to obtain extra oxygen.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will be given a shot in the lower back after cleaning the
              area.
            </li>
            <li>
              The area around the injection site will be numbed with medicine.
              For a short period of time, it may burn and sting. The effect
              should last only a few seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
              A needle will be inserted into your lower back by your healthcare
              provider. As soon as it is in the correct position, he or she will
              adjust it. In order to guide the needle, the physician may use
              X-rays, computed tomography images, or ultrasounds.
            </li>
            <li>
              To ensure that the X-ray contrast dye is injected precisely in the
              right location, the provider will inject a small amount through
              the needle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using the needle, the provider will inject medicine. Different
              types of medicine may be used by him or her for different reasons.
              Pain may need to be blocked with numbing medicine. Inflammation
              may be reduced with the use of steroids. You may experience a
              burning or warm sensation in the area after the medicine has been
              injected.
            </li>
            <h2>What Are The Benefits Of A Lumbar Sympathetic Block?</h2>
            <p>
              Lumbar sympathetic blocks may have the following potential
              benefits:
            </p>
            <li>
              The pain may be temporarily relieved, thereby improving your
              day-to-day functioning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inflammation in the affected nerves is temporarily reduced,
              allowing them to heal more rapidly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Diagnosing the condition. Your provider may be able to identify
              the cause of the pain with the help of the block.
            </li>
            <p>
              The lumbar sympathetic block does not always provide pain relief.
              In this situation, you may need to explore other treatment
              options.
            </p>
            <h2>What are the Expected Results?</h2>
            <p>
              Lumbar sympathetic injections can relieve the affected extremity
              minutes after the procedure. In most cases, you need more
              injections to get long-lasting relief. It's not a good idea to
              drive for several hours after the procedure because you might feel
              numb or weak in the lower extremity. If you're going to have the
              procedure, you should take it easy the day before, but you can
              resume normal activities the next day. The benefits of these
              injections usually happen a few days after the procedure, even
              though you might be sore for a few days. At Pain Management
              Richardson, our team of experienced physicians understands how{" "}

              can adversely affect quality of life.
            </p>
            <h2>Is There a Longer Lasting Therapy?</h2>
            <p>
              As a complementary treatment to lumbar sympathetic injections,
              radiofrequency procedures may be recommended to provide you with
              prolonged relief that otherwise cannot be achieved. The use of
              radiofrequency energy creates heat that impairs the transmission
              of pain signals by desensitizing specific nerves. Typically,
              radiofrequency treatments provide relief for approximately six to
              twelve months and for as long as two years. There is also{" "}

              , which involves implanting a small electrical device to interrupt
              the transmission of pain signals to the brain. Most devices are
              permanent, though they can be removed at any time. The
