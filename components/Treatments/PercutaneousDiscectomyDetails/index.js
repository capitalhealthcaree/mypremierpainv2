            <h4>Percutaneous Discectomy</h4>
            <p>
              This procedure involves removing disc fragments and deviated disc
              material from the spine. Lumbar percutaneous discectomy refers to
              the removal of disc herniations pressing on nerve roots or the
              spinal cord. It involves making an incision between the vertebrae
              and inserting a small surgical needle between them. This procedure
              is minimally invasive. Decompression surgery removes disc material
              from the spine and relieves painful pressure on the nerves.{" "}

            <h2>Overview of the Herniated Disc</h2>
            <p>
              Herniated discs occur when one or more disks rupture within the
              spinal column (backbone). A spine consists of several bones
              (vertebrae) that span from the skull base to the tailbone. Between
              each vertebra, the spine discs act as a cushion. The disks that
              separate your bones enable you to bend and move. Typically, disk
              ruptures are the result of a leak or rupture in the disk. People
              aged 30 to 50 are most likely to suffer from herniated disks.This
              condition is twice as prevalent in men as in women. The pain
              associated with{" "}

              can initially be treated at home. If you experience any of the
              following symptoms, you should consult a physician:
            </p>
            <li>
              A person suffering from pain may find it difficult to go to work.
            </li>
            <li>The symptoms have not improved after four to six weeks.</li>
            <li>Symptoms get worse.</li>
            <li>Feeling uncontrollable</li>
            <li>Your arms, hands, legs, or feet feel tingly, numb, or weak.</li>
            <li>Standing or walking is hard for you.</li>
            <h2>Overview of Discectomy</h2>
            <p>
              Spinal discs cushion vertebrae. A disc consists of two layers. A
              tough cartilage layer is present in the first layer, while a
              gelatinous layer is present in the second layer. Various injuries,
              normal wear and tear, and aging may contribute to bulging discs.
              Discs that hibernate (rupture) may require decompression surgery.
              The most effective treatment for sciatica pain is open surgery
              (removal of the intervertebral disc). The purpose of this
              procedure is to relieve pressure from nerve roots and decompress
              the disc.
            </p>
            <h2>Preparation For A Percutaneous Lumbar Discectomy</h2>
            <p>
              Consult your physician regarding preparations for surgery. You
              should consult your physician prior to the procedure if you are
              taking any medications, such as blood thinners. The night before
              surgery, refrain from drinking alcohol or eating anything after
              midnight. Additional spine imaging tests may be ordered by your
              physician in addition to the MRI.
            </p>
            <h2>Percutaneous Discectomy</h2>
            <p>
              The procedure of percutaneous discectomy is similar to that of
              microdiscectomy in that the disc is removed through the skin. A
              percutaneous discectomy involves the insertion of an endoscopic
              device between the vertebrae and the disc center following an
              incision in the skin. By using the endoscope, doctors are able to
              view what is taking place within the body through cameras. X-rays
              provide guidance in treatment. A tube or series of tubes is used
              during surgery to insert an instrument or a series of instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Percutaneous discectomy procedures are available in a variety of
              forms. During these procedures, anesthesia may be administered
              either locally or generally. There is an instrument inserted
              between the vertebrae and within the disc as part of the
              procedure. During surgery, X-rays guide the movement of surgical
              instruments. The following methods are available for removing disc
              tissue:
            </p>
            <li>Remove the entire disc</li>
            <li>
              An effective method of reducing the volume of a disc is to remove
              the center of the disc in order to restore it to its original
              shape.
            </li>
            <li>Burning or destroying discs with lasers.</li>
            <p>
              Following the removal of the disc pressing on the nerve, the
              patient will experience less pain. Patients suffering from pain
              associated with a bulging disc without outer wall rupture may
              benefit from this procedure. Suffering from back and{" "}
              <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/leg-pain/" rel="preload">
                leg pain
              </Link>
              , including sciatica and radiculopathy, may benefit from a
              percutaneous discectomy. Patients with small, contained
              herniations may benefit from a percutaneous discectomy. The
              procedure may also be of benefit to patients with large, contained
              (nonruptured disc) herniations who are ineligible for open
              surgery.
            </p>
            <h2>Recovery From Percutaneous Lumbar Discectomy</h2>
            <p>
              Your return home will be possible the following day following the
              completion of the procedure. If you are experiencing pain during
              the healing process, your physician may prescribe pain medication
              to alleviate it. You should refrain from driving for several weeks
              after the procedure, from sitting for long periods of time, from
              lifting heavy objects, and from twisting or bending. Occupational
              therapy or physiotherapy may be necessary to strengthen and
              increase the flexibility of your legs. In order to prevent
              recurrence of the problem, preventative measures will be taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typically, patients report significant pain relief following
              percutaneous lumbar discectomy, enabling them to return to their
              normal daily routines. Medical professionals are dedicated to
              improving the quality of life for patients at{" "}

                Desoto spine and pain clinic
              </Link>
              . As an alternative to general anesthesia, percutaneous discectomy
              uses local anesthetic. An office setting is the most common
              setting for outpatient treatment. It usually takes less than an
              hour to complete the treatment.

              Generally, patients can return home within hours of the procedure.
              Many of them can resume normal daily activities within three to
              five days of the procedure. Additionally, there is less risk of
              complications associated with percutaneous discectomy as compared
              to open surgical discectomy. It is the mission of the medical
