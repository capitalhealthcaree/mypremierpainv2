            <h2>ARE YOU AWARE OF DORSAL ROOT GANGLION PROCEDURE?</h2>
            <p>
              In the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), clusters of neurons carry
              sensory information into the spinal cord. Dorsal roots of spinal
              nerves are locations where the nerves branch away from the spine,
              where the ganglions reside. Located in the feet, legs, and arms,
              the Dorsal Root Ganglion Fort Worth typically responds to sensory
              stimuli (including pain). A ganglion connects an organ, limb, or
              skin to the central nervous system. Additionally, the dorsal root
              ganglion is a type of ganglia in the peripheral nervous system.
              There are nerves that originate in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG)
              in the dorsal column (the back of the spinal cord).
            </p>
            <h2>Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)</h2>
            <p>
              A branch of the nerve then spreads throughout the body. An
              effective method for managing chronic pain is to stimulate the
              dorsal root ganglia, which relays signals from the body to the
              brain. A pain management system consists of electrodes and a pulse
              generator. There are contacts on the electrical leads over the DRG
              near the spinal cord. Although DRG stimulation is like spinal cord
              stimulation, it targets painful areas differently than SCS. It is
              possible to implant a pulse generator in our buttocks, lower back,
              or abdominal wall. Using a handheld controller, you are able to
              change the settings for the stimulation.

            <h2>Conditions Treated with Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation</h2>
            <p>
              The FDA approved the use of dorsal root ganglion stimulation for
              the treatment of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS Type 1 and
              2) in the lower extremities in February 2016. Furthermore, spinal
              cord stimulation (SCS) is similar to the procedure described
              above. Because this type of stimulation targets a more precise
              location than traditional SCS, it is more effective for smaller,
              more localized areas of pain. Furthermore, it is particularly
              effective in treating complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS) and
              peripheral neuralgia. The premier pain management centers offer a
              wide range of advanced treatments. Basically, it's to relieve
              severe chronic pain caused by diseases, surgeries, or injuries. A
              pain medicine specialist may deliver electrical pulses to the
              nervous system through dorsal root ganglion stimulation to target
              pain in specific areas of the body.
            </p>
            <h2>Advantages of DRG Stimulation</h2>
            <p>
              In addition to being implanted under the skin, DRG stimulators
              have several leads, which are placed in the buttocks and abdomen.
              Both the pulse generator and the tissue surrounding the target
              area are connected by the leads. By pushing very small electrical
              impulses into the dorsal root ganglion, the leads inhibit pain
              stimulants' transmission to the brain. One week of trials is the
              first step toward ensuring the effectiveness of treatment. As a
              pacemaker is implanted under the skin, the device will be
              implanted into the patient's body within a few days to a week. It
              generally takes 60 to 90 minutes to implant a bone.
            </p>
            <h3>1- Directed Anatomical Targeting</h3>
            <p>
              Dorsal Root Ganglion Desoto stimulation allows selective
              stimulation of the area in pain due to the highly targeted nature
              of the stimulation field. Ninety-four percent of the patients in
              the ACCURATE Study received targeted DRG stimulation without
              extraneous paresthesia in the area of pain.{" "}
            </p>
            <h3>2- Marginal Risk Of Lead Migration</h3>
            <p>
              Lead migration is likely to be limited due to the limited space
              for the dorsal root ganglion. The ACCURATE study found that
              stimulation leads did not migrate more than 1% of the time.
              Migration rates are reported by traditional SCS at 14 percent.
            </p>
            <h3>3- Low Energy Requirements</h3>
            <p>
              An extremely thin layer of spinal fluid surrounds the dorsal root
              ganglion Hillsboro. Because of the narrow layer of tissue between
              the stimulator and the dorsal root ganglion cells, DRG stimulation
              only consumes approximately 10% of the energy necessary for
              traditional SCS. This results in a longer battery life.
            </p>
            <h3>4- Minimal Postural Effects</h3>
            <p>
              Due to its small size and the cerebral spinal fluid that surrounds
              it, the pattern of stimulation for the dorsal root ganglion
              Richardson remains constant despite changes in body position.No
              matter where the patient lies, stands, sits or walks, he or she
              receives the same stimulation.
            </p>
            <h2>How Is Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation Performed?</h2>
            <p>
              A minor surgical procedure is required for the stimulation of the
              dorsal root ganglion North Richland Hills. An MRI or fluoroscopy
              is used to insert small wires into the spine. Wires in the back
              connect an implantable device (similar to a pacemaker). After the
              wires and device are in place, an electric pulse can be
              transmitted to the brain with the assistance of a remote control
              that interrupts pain messages traveling from the peripheral
              nerves. Several studies have shown that electrical pulses may
              reduce pain within a particular body region by causing overactive
              neurons to return to a more settled state. Moreover, it is
              possible to conduct a trial prior to the surgical installation of
              the wires and device in order to determine the patient's response
              to the therapy.
            </p>
            <h2>Is DRG Therapy Right For You?</h2>
            <p>
              You may benefit from DRG therapy if you have the following
              conditions: Six-month or longer chronic pain. The pain associated
              with an injury or surgical procedure in a lower part of the body
              Moreover, pain medications, nerve blocks, and neurostimulation all
              do not provide sufficient relief Moreover, it's possible that DRG
              therapy can provide partial relief from this kind of pain where
              other treatments have not. Dr ali pain management, has recently
              developed an innovative new procedure called the Dorsal Root
              Ganglion Procedure.
