            <h2>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT</h2>
            <h4>Mild Procedure, Mild Surgery</h4>
            <p>
              There may be pain or cramping in your legs when you stand for a
              long period of time when you have spinal stenosis affecting the
              nerves in your lower back, called the lumbar spine. You may also
              experience{" "}
              <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/back-pain/" rel="preload">
                back pain
              </Link>{" "}
              when standing up or walking. Bending forward or sitting usually
              alleviates this discomfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a mild surgery, a mild procedure that can lead to a
              reduction in pain and an increase in standing and walking distance
              for individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). No general
              anesthesia, implants, or stitches are required for this short
              outpatient procedure. As a result of participation in the study,
              participants reported significant pain reduction and increased
              mobility. The mild procedure also carries a very low risk of major
              complications. Patients who don't respond to these conservative
              treatments may qualify for mild, a minimally invasive lumbar
              decompression treatment that is guided by X-ray/fluoroscopic
              images.

              Chronic lower back pain patients benefit from the{" "}

              . There are many benefits that can be obtained from the mild
              procedure for patients who suffer from lumbar spinal stenosis.
              Patients may experience the following benefits as a result of the
              treatment:
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Minimal Invasiveness:</b> You will not have huge scars from
              mild surgery, mild procedure (minimal incision). Compared to
              regular surgery, recovery is faster with minimally invasive
              surgery.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Safe:</b> Using MILD is safe, it's not experimental. Thousands

              <b>Anesthetic-Free:</b> General anesthesia has risks. The MILD
              procedure Hilsboro doesn't require it.
            </li>
            <h2>Who Is A Candidate?</h2>
            <p>
              If over-the-counter medications, physical therapy, or therapeutic
              injections haven't worked for you, this mild procedure may be
              right for you. The following characteristics are characteristicof
              good candidates:
            </p>
            <li>
              Stand upright without experiencing pain or numbness in their lower
              back.
            </li>
            <li>
              When experiencing pain, numbness, or tingling in their legs or
              buttocks, it is recommended that they refrain from walking.
            </li>
            <li>
              It may be necessary to bend forward at the waste or to sit down in
              order to relieve the discomfort.
            </li>
            <p>
              This is what neurogenic claudication looks like. A spinal stenosis
              is a condition in which the spinal cord nerve root canal narrows,
              causing impairment in walking. In appropriate cases, the mild
              procedure may be an alternative to lumbar laminectomy surgery,
              including patients with moderate to severe symptoms and who have
              attempted conservative treatment without success.
            </p>
            <h2> LSS Pain Treatment</h2>

              is an outpatient procedure that requires no general anesthesia or
              stitches for the treatment of LSS caused by excess ligaments.

              . As a brief overview of the procedure, here are the steps:
            </p>
            <li>
              A tiny incision is made on your back and special tools are
              inserted through it
            </li>
            <li>
              During this procedure, small pieces of bone and excess ligament
              are removed, which causes the canal to narrow
            </li>
            <li>
              Treatment of LSS has been compared to "removing a kink in a
              drinking straw" by some doctors
            </li>
            <li>An imaging machine guides the procedure</li>
            <li>
              A reduction in the compression of the nerves in the spinal canal
              is caused by the restoration of space within the canal
            </li>
            <li>
              Consequently, the pain is reduced and the mobility is restored

            <h2>What Is The Expected Outcome And How Long Will It Take?</h2>
            <p>
              It is usually possible to perform MILD on an outpatient basis in
              less than an hour.The procedure is safe, effective, and
              significantly reduces pain in LSS patients. It is imperative to
              take into account the following factors in addition to MILD:

            <h2>Instructions For Post-Operative Care</h2>
            <p>
              If you will be undergoing surgery on a Saturday, you should take a
              "lazy" day. It is pertinent to note that back pain can range in
              severity. Please follow your physician's instructions regarding
              the use of pain medications.
            </p>
            <li>
              For the next seven days, you should apply ice packs to your back.
            </li>
            <li>
              There will be a variation in the amount of time OFF work for
              different individuals. Consult your physician.
            </li>
            <li>
              The morning following your procedure, you may shower or bathe.
            </li>
            <li>
              If blood or fluid leaks from the wound, the bandage will be able
              to collect it.

            <li>Once there is no drainage, you may remove it.</li>
            <li>
              If you feel comfortable driving after 3 days, you may do so. When
              driving, it is critical to exercise your judgment - if you are not
              in a stable condition, please consult your physician first.

              We recommend that you schedule an appointment to see our office
