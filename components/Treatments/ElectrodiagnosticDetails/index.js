            <h2>IS ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC TESTING HELPFUL?</h2>
            <p>
              The human body is likened to an electrical generator. Nerves and
              muscles are responsible for delivering electrical signals to and
              from your brain. A damaged nerve or muscle can slow or prevent the
              transmission of electrical signals. A measurement of the
              electrical activity in your nerves and muscles can detect back,
              neck, or limb pain, weakness, or numbness. An electrodiagnostic
              test measures how quickly and strongly electrical impulses travel
              through nerves and muscles. Electrodiagnostic is an important tool
              for pain management in Richardson , Texas. A damaged nerve or
              muscle will transmit a weaker and slower electrical signal.
            </p>
            <h2>Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)</h2>
            <p>
              It is common to perform NCS as well as an EMG to determine whether
              a nerve is functioning normally or not. During the test, the
              doctor will apply wires (electrodes) along the nerve pathway to
              the skin. An electric current is then applied to the nerve by the
              doctor. Electrodes placed along the nerve pathway capture the
              signal as it travels along the pathway and measure its speed.
              Electrical signals can travel as fast as 120 miles per hour in
              healthy nerves. A damaged nerve, however, will result in a slower
              and weaker signal. A doctor can determine the specific location of
              the problem by stimulating the nerve at various locations. In
              addition, nerve conduction studies are useful in monitoring a
              nerve's recovery following an injury.

            <h2>Electromyography (EMG)</h2>
            <p>
              The EMG records and analyzes the electrical activity of muscles.
              Consequently the purpose of this test is to learn more about the
              functioning of the nerves connecting the spinal cord to the
              muscles. When the muscle is at rest, it is electrically silent. An
              EMG consists of placing small, thin needles in selected muscles to
              record electrical activity. You may experience pain and discomfort
              during the needle insertion. The doctor will ask you to relax the
              muscle and tense it slightly. The doctor will listen and watch a
              TV-like screen that broadcasts electrical signals. Additionally,
              you may also hear the sound when moving the muscle.
              Electrodiagnostics may be used to evaluate radiculopathies, carpal
              tunnel syndrome, myopathies and peripheral neuropathies, just to
              name a few.
            </p>

            <h2>Preparing for an EMG</h2>
            <li>Eat and drink normally.</li>
            <li>Do not apply lotions or body creams as they can interfere.</li>
            <li>
              You may want to wear shorts and a short sleeve shirt, or you will
              need to change into a gown.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notify the technician and physician if you are taking blood
              thinners. If you are taking pyridostigmine (Mestinon), it should
              be held for 12 hours prior to testing with your physician's
              consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Studies take 40 minutes to 1 ½ hours depending on the complexity.

            <h2>What To Expect On Your EMG Day</h2>
            <p>
              Electrodiagnostic testing is an important tool for pain management
              in Hillsboro . On the day of your EMG, avoid lotions or oils.
              During testing, it is advisable to layer your clothing to
              facilitate removal. We will show you to the testing room when you
              arrive at the clinic. Prior to the procedure, please remove any
              jewelry or metal objects that may interfere with the procedure or
              results. If your doctor tests your muscles, they may ask you to
              sit or lay down. There will be a sterile needle inserted into your
              muscle and an electrode nearby. As a result of this electrode,
              your doctor will be able to monitor your movements and determine
              if there is an underlying condition. This is based on the
              electrical signal. The needle may cause some slight discomfort
              during insertion, and it may be necessary to insert the needle
              multiple times. Please inform your physician if the procedure
              becomes painful. When the doctor relaxes and contracts the
              muscles, he examines them. An EMG procedure can take 10 to 90
              minutes, depending on the muscle type.
            </p>
            <h2>Based On Your Testing</h2>
            <p>
              Your referring physician will let you know when you can expect
              your results once he or she receives the electrodiagnostic test
              results. Following your procedure, you may resume any normal
              activities. Occasionally, you may experience soreness and
              tenderness following an electromyography (EMG). When it comes to
              pain management in Fort Worth pain management in Fort Worth,
              electrodiagnostic testing is a reliable tool that can provide
              valuable insight into the underlying causes of pain.
            </p>
            <h2>How Long Does It take?</h2>
            <p>
              In a sterile, office-based environment, electrodiagnostics can be
              safely performed. Depending on the symptoms and the number of
              nerves and muscles to be tested, the tests can last anywhere from
              15 minutes to two hours. Patients who wear lotion on the day of
              the test will have difficulty collecting data.
            </p>
            <h2>What Are The Expected Results?</h2>
            <p>
              In most cases, patients resume work or normal activities after
              completing a study. This diagnostic tool provides information that
              can help determine the most effective treatment strategy for
              chronic premier pain caused by nerve and muscle damage.
