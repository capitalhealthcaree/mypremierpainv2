              to be a result of inflammation in the sacroiliac joints (SI) that
              connect the spine to the pelvis at the base of the spine.
              Additionally, it can also cause groin, buttock, and{" "}

              . Numerous reasons may cause these symptoms, and they occur
              frequently. A treatment plan can begin once your doctor confirms
              your pain is due to SI joint dysfunction, which doesn't respond
              well to generalized pain relief.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of sacroiliac joint injections is twofold: Their role
              is to diagnose and treat{" "}

              . Using SI joint injections is an effective method of diagnosing
              and treating SI joint dysfunctions. One may perform the procedures
              separately, with a purely diagnostic injection, or one may combine
              them. This treatment may be of benefit to those suffering from
              lower back pain .{" "}

            <h2>Si Injection Role For Diagnostic Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              Physicians may administer injections into the sacroiliac joint in
              order to treat symptoms associated with inflammation. In order to
              confirm or rule out a diagnosis, physicians are able to administer
              powerful numbing agents directly into the sacroiliac joint under
              X-ray guidance. An injection into the sacroiliac joint may
              alleviate symptoms. For patients with pain arising from the
              targeted joint, a second injection of a different anesthetic may
              be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

            <h2>Si Injection Role For Therapeutic Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              It may be appropriate to consider injections of corticosteroids as
              a possible treatment option for individuals with SI joint pain. If
              oral medication does not provide sufficient relief, some
              physicians may recommend injections. Patients experiencing
              breakthrough pain may receive injections several times per year in
              conjunction with oral medication. A comprehensive conservative
              treatment plan usually includes injections of the sacroiliac joint
              prior to deciding on surgical intervention.

            <h2>The Sacroiliac Joint Injection Procedure</h2>
            <p>
              <Link href="/contact-locations/richardson/" rel="preload">
                Richardson Pain Management
              </Link>{" "}
              can provide assistance with joint pain for a variety of reasons.
              The procedure usually takes just a few minutes and patients are
              able to return home the same day. A separate procedure room or an
              operating room is usually used for sacroiliac joint injections.
              Injection procedures typically involve the following steps:
            </p>
            <li>
              A patient is positioned on the radiography table face down after
              informed consent has been obtained. You may place a pillow under
              your hips during the procedure in order to ensure your comfort.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is necessary to monitor the patient's vital signs and pulse
              rate during the procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Depending on the patient's preference, the physician may insert an
              intravenous line to administer medication to assist in relaxation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Injecting sterile gloves and applying iodine or alcohol solutions
              to the skin overlying the sacroiliac joint injection preserves
              sterility.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prior to placing the needle under fluoroscopy guidance, the
              insertion site may be numb with anesthetic. A contrast dye is
              injected into the sacroiliac joint after the needle is placed to
              verify the placement and spread of the solution.
            </li>
            <li>
              A diagnostic or therapeutic medication is injected into the joint
              once the needle has been guided into the joint successfully.
            </li>
            <li>
              In general, an injection consists of two types of medications:
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to confirm that the patient's pain is originating from
              the sacroiliac joint, a diagnostic injection is performed using
              this solution.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition to reducing inflammation within the joint, the use of
              anti-inflammatory medications (usually corticosteroid medications)
              may also help relieve pain for a longer period of time (typically
              several months, or even a year) by reducing inflammation. This
              solution is administered to the sacroiliac joint as a therapeutic
              injection.
            </li>
            <h2>How Does A Sacroiliac Joint Injection Affect The Body?</h2>
            <p>
              A monitoring period of approximately 30 minutes will follow the
              procedure. The person driving you home may be able to assist you.
              If there are any restrictions on activity following the procedure,
              consult your doctor. As well, ask whether you can apply heat or
              ice to the area of the shot, and whether you can bathe the day
              after.
            </p>
            <li>
              Please follow all directions provided by your healthcare provider,
              including those regarding your medications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Following the injection, you may feel sore and have some weakness
              in your leg for a few hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you experience pain related to the sacroiliac joint, a numbing
              agent may provide pain relief for the next few hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the pain wears off throughout the day, it may become more
              severe.
            </li>
            <li>
              When prescribed by your healthcare provider, steroid medicine may
              take up to seven days to reduce pain and inflammation in your
              joint.
            </li>
            <li>
              Therefore, you may feel better for a few hours after receiving the
              injection. You may experience more pain following the
              administration of the steroid.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may be asked to maintain a pain diary following the injection
              by your healthcare provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              By keeping a diary, you can determine whether your pain is related
              to the sacroiliac joint.
            </li>
            <li>
              Based on the results of this study, an injection may also be
              beneficial in the future.
            </li>
            <p>
              Symptoms such as the following should be reported to your
              healthcare provider:
            </p>
            <li>Intense pain</li>
            <li>
              A leg that has been weak or numb for longer than a few hours.
            </li>
            <li>Symptoms of fever</li>
            <li>A sign of infection at the site of injection.</li>
            <li>
              Symptoms such as redness, swelling, and oozing may be present.
