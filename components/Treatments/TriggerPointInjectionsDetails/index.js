            <h4>Trigger Point Injections?</h4>
            <p>
              A trigger point injection may alleviate symptoms of chronic muscle
              pain, such as neck pain. Injection of trigger points aims to
              relieve pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion caused by
              knots in the muscles.It may require injection of anesthetics or
              steroids. Muscles injured suddenly or repeatedly may develop
              trigger points. In order to identify trigger points, physicians
              can feel tender bumps under the skin of the neck, shoulders, and
              back.{" "}

            <h2>Trigger Points: What Are They?</h2>
            <p>
              An injury or excessive use of muscles may result in trigger points
              developing in tight bands of muscles. A condition known as
              myofascial pain syndrome is characterized by persistent and
              increasing muscle pain over time. Trigger points, which form in
              tight bands of muscle, lead to pain both at the knot and
              throughout the muscle. Myofascial pain syndrome, a leading cause
              of chronic pain affecting the jaw, head, shoulders, neck, back,
              and other areas, is effectively addressed by{" "}

            </p>
            <p>
              When muscle tissue is unable to relax and function normally,
              myofascial trigger points develop. You may feel knots in the
              affected muscle if you rub it. A sensitive muscle trigger point
              may result in persistent neck tension, resulting in a decreased
              range of motion and an accompanying dull ache. Overuse or sudden
              stress can cause trigger points to develop in your muscles. In the
              neck, they are generally found in the following muscles:
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Rhomboid:</b> It is the rhombic muscles that connect the
              shoulder blades to the rib cage and spine of the upper back, which
              permits you to maintain an upright posture. The trigger points of
              the rhombic muscles are found under the neck, between the spine
              and the shoulder blades.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Trapezius:</b> Located in the upper back, shoulders, and neck,
              the trapezius is a large muscle group. At the back of the neck and
              along the top of the shoulders, you may feel a trigger point in
              the trapezius.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Levator Scapulae:</b> Trigger points in this muscle are located
              at the back and side of your neck.
            </li>
            <h2>How Does Trigger Point Injection Work?</h2>
            <p>
              This type of therapy involves injecting a needle into a specific
              area of pain in a muscle (trigger point). A doctor's office at{" "}
              <Link href="/contact-locations/cleburne/" rel="preload">
                pain relief clinic Cleburne
              </Link>{" "}
              can perform this procedure without sedation. Most injections
              contain only local anesthetics. As the patient's position changes
              during the procedure, he or she may lie or sit.
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Identifying Such Trigger Points:</b> First, your physician will
              palpate the muscle and identify the areas that are painful. Once
              your physician has identified such trigger points, he or she will
              inject them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Identifying The Underlying Cause:</b> Trigger points cannot be
              diagnosed with imaging because they do not appear on x-rays or
              MRIs. However, these tests may be useful if an underlying
              condition is contributing to the trigger point.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Injections Made At Trigger Points:</b> It may be necessary to
              administer more than one injection depending on the number of
              trigger points identified. One doctor may inject several trigger
              points during a single appointment. It takes only a few minutes to
              complete the procedure.
            </li>
            <h2>How Do Trigger Point Injections Work?</h2>
            <p>
              A blockage of pain receptors within the nerves surrounding the
              muscle occurs as a result of the injection of anesthetic
              medication into the muscle. As a result, the brain will receive
              fewer pain signals. By using steroid medication, you can reduce
              inflammation and swelling around the nerves, reducing pain. A
              needle may even be able to provide relief on its own without any
              medication on account of its mechanical properties. Patients who
              are allergic to anesthetic medications may benefit from this
              procedure, called "needling," by separating, relaxing, and
              lengthening muscle fibers. For patients with painful trigger
              points,{" "}

            <h2>Why You Might Need Trigger Point Injection</h2>
            <p>
              There are many reasons why trigger point injections may be a good
              option for treating your{" "}
              <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/neck-pain/" rel="preload">
                neck pain
              </Link>
              , as they can treat a wide array of muscles throughout the body.
              There are several different ways to treat trigger points,
              including treating them in the neck, lower back, arms, and legs.
              By using this method, you would be able to relieve the pain in
              these areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has been shown that trigger point injections can be effective
              in treating neck pain and inflammation, as well as tension
              headaches and fibromyalgia. In order to alleviate this chronic
              pain, you may consider this treatment for the purpose of
              alleviating some of its potential benefits for myofascial pain
              syndrome. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these treatments has
              not been determined, so you may wish to consider them as a
              possible treatment for myofascial pain. If you have persistent
              neck pain that doesn't go away for over a week, see your doctor.

              and diagnosis guidelines.

            <h2>Are There Any Risks?</h2>
            <p>
              It is generally safe to inject trigger points and there are rarely
              any complications or side effects associated with this procedure.
              Typically, side effects are minor and include:

                <li>An injury to the muscles or nerves</li>

              </div>{" "}
              <div className="col-6">
                <li>An infection of the skin</li>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              Pain flare-ups may occur after injections for some individuals.
              This condition is usually treated with cold packs and
              over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers. The use of trigger point
              injections may not be appropriate if you have an active infection
              in the area being treated or if you are afraid of needles.
            </p>
            <h2>The Bottom line</h2>
            <p>
              Numerous methods for alleviating neck pain are available,
              including trigger point injections, which are administered by{" "}
              <Link href="/meet-our-team/" rel="preload">
                pain specialists in Dallas.

              These injections, consisting of a local anesthetic and/or a
              steroid, are delivered into your muscles with the aim of reducing
              pain and enhancing function. You can ask your doctor if trigger
              point injections do not provide immediate relief for you. If
              trigger point injections do not relieve your neck pain, your
              doctor may be able to recommend alternative treatment options. Our{" "}
