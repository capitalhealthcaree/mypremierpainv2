            <p>
              Hip pain is a common clinical complaint and a significant cause of
              disability among adults over the age of 60. It is possible for
              anyone to experience hip pain because of many reasons like
              arthritis, overuse and injury. A number of nonsurgical treatments
              are available for the treatment of hip pain, including the
              injection of hyaluronic acid, corticosteroids, and plasma-rich
              platelets. Hip joint injections involve injecting medicine into
              the hip joint. Inflammation and pain may be reduced with the use
              of the medicine. It can also help diagnose{" "}

              By injecting numbing medicine into the joint, we can confirm or
              rule out the joint as the cause of pain based on how much pain
              relief we face immediately. When the patient does not feel pain
              upon numbing of the joint, the joint may be considered the cause
              of pain.

              The injection includes numbing medicine as well as a

              placed at its right place and nerves are safe from any kind of
              injury. Physician uses contrast dyes for confirmation of
              absorption of medicine into the joint at exact place. After the
              dye has been injected, the medicine slowly releases into the
              joint.

      </p>
      <li>
        The patient will be given an IV line so that appropriate relaxation
        medicine can be administered if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the X-ray table, the skin over the patient's hip is cleansed
        thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        An anesthetic (a numbing medicine) is used by the physician to numb a
        small area of skin. For a short period of time, the patient may feel a
        mild sting.
      </li>
      <li>
        A very small needle is inserted into the joint under the guidance of an
        X-ray (fluoroscopy). In order to confirm that the medicine reaches the
        exact place of joint, several drops of contrast dye are also used.
      </li>
      <li>
        The joint is then slowly injected with a mixture of anesthetic and
        anti-inflammatory cortisone.
      </li>
      <h2>Post-Injection Procedure</h2>

        rest on the table for approximately twenty to thirty minutes.

        is normally uncomfortable.
      </li>
      <li>
        After few hours of injection, patients may or may not feel pain relief.
        Whether the joint that was injected is the primary source of the
        patient's pain will determine whether this is the best course of action.
      </li>
      <li>
        Occasionally, the patient may experience numbness or a weak or odd
        sensation in the leg following the injection.
      </li>
      <li>

        and the level of pain relief will be recorded for the next week.

        treating physician, planning future tests, and managing pain.
      </li>
      <h2>Expected Results</h2>
      <p>
        Injections of hip joints have proven to be a successful alternative to
        surgery for patients suffering from hip pain. It takes one to two days
        for you to recover after the procedure. You should not move yourself to
        perform any activity instead you should wait to recover completely.
        After the procedure, you are likely to experience immediate relief, and
        the corticosteroid medicine is likely to provide long-term relief.
