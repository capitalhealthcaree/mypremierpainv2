            <h2>IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT</h2>
            <h4>Genicular Nerve Block</h4>
            <p>
              The use of prescribed medications is often ineffective in managing
              chronic osteoarthritis{" "}
              <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/knee-pain/" rel="preload">
                knee pain
              </Link>
              . As a therapeutic alternative for managing chronic pain
              associated with osteoarthritis of the knee, radiofrequency (RF)
              ablation can be applied to the articular nerve branches (genicular
              nerves).
            </p>
            <p>
              However, there is a possibility that some older individuals with
              chronic conditions may not be suitable candidates for surgery even
              if they have advanced disease. Additionally, there are some
              patients who do not wish to undergo surgery and prefer
              non-surgical treatments. Radiation frequency ablation of the
              genicular nerves may be an effective alternative to surgery in
              these patients. In order to relieve pain and restore function, a
              nerve supply can be cut to a painful structure.

            <h2>Genicular Nerve: What Are They?</h2>
            <p>
              A knee's nerves permit it to feel and move. There are three nerves
              that make up the genicular nerve: superior medial, inferior
              medial, and superior lateral. An irritated or damaged nerve can
              cause knee pain. In order to treat genicular nerves in the knee,{" "}
              <Link href="/contact-locations/fort-worth/" rel="preload">
                Pain Management Fort Worth
              </Link>{" "}
              offers a comprehensive approach.
            </p>
            <h2>How does a Genicular Nerve Block Work?</h2>
            <li>
              A genicular nerve block may be appropriate for patients with
              <Link href="/contact-locations/cleburne/" rel="preload">
                {" "}
                chronic knee pain cleburne
              </Link>{" "}
              that does not respond to conservative treatment. In this
              procedure, nerve supply to a painful area is blocked in hopes of
              alleviating pain and restoring function.
            </li>
            <li>
              Knee joints are innervated by various nerves such as the femoral,
              common peroneal, saphenous, tibial, and obturator nerves.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the name suggests, these branches surround the knee joint and
              are commonly called genicular nerves.
            </li>
            <li>
              A needle can be easily inserted under fluoroscopic guidance into a
              number of genicular nerves.
            </li>
            <li>
              To determine whether a genicular nerve block will provide adequate
              relief to patients, a diagnostic genicular nerve block can be
              performed.
            </li>
            <li>
              During a genicular nerve block, local anesthetic is injected
              through small needles to temporarily block these nerves.
            </li>
            <li>
              Live X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy) ensures efficient needle
              placement. The procedure generally takes between five and ten
              minutes.
            </li>
            <h2>General Considerations</h2>
            <p>
              Radiofrequency ablation therapy and genicular nerve blocks were
              initially described as methods for treating severe chronic knee
              pain. Recently, an expanded version of the block technique was
              introduced under ultrasound guidance to provide analgesia
              following knee surgery. The strength of the quadriceps muscle is
              preserved when only the sensory branches are targeted to the knee
              joint.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consequently, this novel analgesic technique can be used as an
              alternative to femoral nerve and adductor canal blocks when these
              procedures are not indicated or desirable. A genicular nerve block
              was performed under fluoroscopy guidance for the first time.
              Besides providing additional visualization of soft tissues and
              blood vessels that are essential to identifying the injection
              site, ultrasound facilitates the recognition of these landmarks.
              The available data on genicular nerve blocks in the context of
              perioperative procedures is limited; however, case series have
              shown promising outcomes. The effectiveness of this novel
              treatment for acute pain following total knee replacement is
              currently being investigated in clinical trials.
            </p>
            <h2>The Purpose Of A Genicular Nerve Block Is To Relieve Pain</h2>
            <p>The purpose of a genicular nerve block is twofold:</p>
            <li>
              When conservative treatments have not relieved chronic knee pain,
              such as physical therapy, over-the-counter NSAIDs, or injections
              of steroid knee joints, your healthcare provider may recommend a
              genicular nerve block. This treatment may result in the relief of
              pain. A variety of factors may contribute to chronic knee pain,
              including injury and osteoarthritis.
            </li>
            <li>
              The genicular nerve block can help manage moderate to severe
              postoperative knee pain after knee surgery, such as a total knee
              replacement. Before surgery, your anesthesiologist or surgeon may
              perform this procedure. Additionally, they use peripheral nerve
              blocks in addition to general anesthesia.
            </li>

              offers comprehensive treatment and diagnosis guidelines that can
              help individuals regain health.
            </p>
            <li>
              A genicular nerve block is usually performed by a healthcare
              provider as an outpatient procedure for the management of pain.
              Consequently, you will not be admitted to a hospital for the
              procedure and will be able to return home afterward.
            </li>
            <li>
              Generally, a genicular nerve block will result in the following
              symptoms: On a procedure table, you will lie on your back.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to slightly elevate your affected knee, a provider will
              place a small pillow under it.
            </li>
            <li>
              A mild sedative may be administered through an IV line in your arm
              if you wish to relax.
            </li>
            <li>
              The provider will use an antiseptic solution to clean your knee
              skin. In order to numb the area where the nerve block will be
              performed, a local anesthetic injection will be given to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              The needle may cause you to feel a pinch or discomfort as it
              enters your skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              A provider may use imaging guidance, such as ultrasound or
              fluoroscopy, in order to determine the precise location of an
              injection.
            </li>
            <li>
              The medication will then be injected into the affected nerve(s) as
              close to the site as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The medication will take effect after you have undergone the
              procedure. Approximately five to ten minutes are required to
              complete the procedure.
            </li>
            <h2>Complications</h2>
            <p>
              The risk of complications is extremely low, especially when
              injections are performed with precision needle positioning.
              Aseptic precautions can prevent septic arthritis. Generally, local
              anaesthetics do not cause severe allergic reactions. Pain
              flare-ups following surgical procedures are not uncommon, and may
              be treated with pain medications. Several neurological
              complications have been reported, including paraesthesia and
              numbness. Underlying skin can become numb following radiofrequency
              treatment. Due to the strict aseptic conditions under which the
              procedure is performed and the specific nature of the injections,
              the incidence of infection is low.{" "}
