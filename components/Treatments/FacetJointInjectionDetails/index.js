              are minimally invasive procedures that numb facet joints by
              injecting local anesthetic and/or medication. The needle is guided
              into the facet joint using fluoroscopy, a real-time radiographic
              imaging technique, or computed tomography.
            </p>
            <p>
              An injection of a facet joint under fluoroscopy (live X-ray) is
              most effective (and prevents nerve injury). An ambulatory surgical
              center or an office-based procedure suite is usually used to
              inject the facet joints.A facet joint medial branch block,

              facet joint to determine if it alleviates your back pain.

            <h2>Preparation Facet Injections</h2>
            <p>
              The procedure for injection of the facet must be prepared in
              advance. Furthermore, measures will be taken before, during, and
              after the completion of the process in order to ensure its
              success. Aside from that, there are some patients who should not
              be injected with facet fluid, including the following:
            </p>
            <li>
              A patient with an allergy to local anesthetics, contrast agents,
              or steroids may require a different type of anesthetic
            </li>
            <li>Infections caused by bacteria, whether local or systemic</li>
            <li>Pregnant patients</li>
            <li>Blood disorders patients</li>
            <li>Infected or tumorous spinal patients</li>
            <li>Diabetes patients or patients with congestive heart failure</li>
            <p>
              As part of the evaluation process, your physician will discuss
              potential risks and benefits with you as well as answer any
              questions you may have. If you are suffering from bleeding
              disorders or are taking blood thinners, you should inform your
              doctor prior to the procedure. Certain medications, such as
              aspirin, may also increase the likelihood of bleeding
              complications. If you are taking blood thinners or other
              medications, your primary care physician will ask you before the
              procedure. The following steps must be completed on the day of
              your procedure:
            </p>
            <li>Regularly wash your skin with soap after showering</li>
            <li>
              Medicated creams and lotions should not be used around the
              injection site
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure that your clothing is dark and loose, including your
              underwear
            </li>
            <li>
              Make arrangements for someone to drive you to and from your
              appointment
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep a copy of your most recent imaging studies and report on hand
            </li>
            <li>Ensure that your medication and allergy list is up-to-date</li>
            <p>
              In addition to reviewing your medications and allergies, the nurse
              will ask you screening questions. The time for your injection,
              overseen by{" "}

              </Link>{" "}
              will be announced once you are prepared. Especially if this is
              your first spinal procedure, the use of an IV line may be
              required.

            is a minimally invasive procedure performed as an outpatient within
            a few hours. Most procedures take no more than fifteen minutes to
            complete.
          </p>
          <li>
            A local anesthetic is usually administered to patients, but in
            certain circumstances, a general anesthetic may be administered.
          </li>
          <li>
            An examination table will be placed in front of the patient during
            the procedure. The area to be injected will be numbed with a topical
            numbing agent prior to the injection of the local anesthetic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the needle has been inserted and guided by a fluoroscopic dye,
            an anesthetic and steroid will be injected into the facet joint.
          </li>
          <li>
            A steroid reduces inflammation and irritation, while an anesthetic
            numbs pain.
          </li>
          <li>
            By spreading to other spinal levels and portions, the combination
            medicine reduces inflammation and irritation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the needle has been removed, a dressing will be applied to the
            injection site.
          </li>
          <li>
            In most cases, the patient is escorted home by an escort two hours
            after the procedure. Under no circumstances is a patient permitted
            to drive home after{" "}

            After-surgery care Within 15-20 minutes following the procedure, the
            pain score was assessed. For the next 20 minutes, you should be on

            diary for the next two weeks
