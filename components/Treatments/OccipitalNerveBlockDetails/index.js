            <h4>TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES</h4>
            <p>
              Occipital nerve blocks can have varying results depending on the
              individual. Cluster headaches and occipital neuralgia can be
              temporarily relieved with occipital nerve blocks. As a result of
              injuries, including whiplash, neck and head pain may also be
              alleviated. A variety of reasons can cause pain, and{" "}

              can provide relief.

            <h2>How Does An Occipital Nerve Block Work?</h2>
            <p>
              This procedure involves combining steroid medication
              (methylprednisolone) with a local anesthetic (lidocaine) to
              inhibit the occipital nerve. Located on the top of the head, the
              occipital nerve extends from the back of the neck. Your child will
              receive the injection as a day case, which means they will be
              injected and then sent home on the same day. In order to treat
              children who suffer from one-sided headaches or tender scalps, an
              injection of an occipital nerve block may be worth considering.
              Nevertheless, they may not be suitable for everyone, and other
              treatments may be recommended.

            <h2>What Does an Occipital Nerve Block Treat?</h2>
            <p>
              Different types of head pain can be treated with an occipital
              nerve block, including:
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Occipital Neuralgia</b>: The symptoms of occipital neuralgia
              consist of a severe throbbing pain in the back of the head, upper
              neck, or behind the ears caused by irritation of the occipital
              nerves. Research indicates that an occipital nerve block may be
              effective for treating this type of headache. Organizations
              consider nerve blocks to be a common, non-surgical treatment
              option.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Migraines</b>: In addition to headaches caused by nerve
              irritation, an occipital nerve block can also provide relief from
              other headache symptoms. The occipital nerves may be responsible
              for transmitting pain signals to the brain, resulting in
              migraines. The blocking of these signals may be necessary to
              relieve pain related to your occipital nerves.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cluster Headaches</b>: In terms of pain, cluster headaches rank
              among the most severe. A cluster headache is characterized by
              cyclical patterns and may wake you up at night. An intense amount
              of pain is felt on one side of the head as well as around one eye
              as a result of these conditions. Facet joints of the cervical
              spine are affected by spondylosis. An age-related wear and tear of
              the neck bones and discs results in spondylosis of the cervical
              facet joints, commonly referred to as osteoarthritis of the neck
              joints.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cervicogenic Headache</b>: The American Migraine Foundation
              describes cervicogenic headaches as headaches that originate in or
              around the neck. A study conducted in 2006 found that people who
              were treated with an occipital nerve block reported symptom relief
              within two weeks of treatment. Additionally, later research
              confirmed its efficacy in treating cervicogenic headaches.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Diagnostic Procedure</b>: Other conditions may also be
              diagnosed using the occipital nerve block. It can be difficult to
              differentiate pain that originates from your occipital nerves from
              pain that originates from other parts of your spine. A{" "}

              understand how pain can affect your life.The occipital nerve block
              procedure is performed by injecting a teaspoon of local anesthetic
              and steroids into the scalp near the nerve trunk. This procedure
              involves administering injections approximately two inches above
              the neck at the back of the head. Following the numbering of the
              skin, injections are administered.
            </p>
            <li>Nerve blocks are administered with a very fine needle.</li>
            <li>
              A well-placed injection may provide immediate relief from pain for
              patients within minutes of receiving it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Patients may be asked about their symptoms by their physicians.
              When the nerve is swollen, steroids will relieve the pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Approximately two to three days following the administration of
              steroids, the full effect of steroids will be felt. Some of these
              effects, however, can last for weeks or months.
            </li>
            <li>
              Occipital nerve blocks usually result in patients being able to
              drive home the following day and resume their normal activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the local anesthetic wears off, the effects of the steroid
              will become apparent in the following days.
            </li>
            <li>
              A patient whose pain is relatively recent rather than
              long-standing will typically respond best to an occipital nerve
              block.
            </li>
            <li>
              The patient may need a second occipital nerve block if their
              symptoms do not improve after the first injection. Symptoms may
              need to be controlled with additional nerve blocks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, a lack of results may suggest that the occipital
              nerves are not responsible for the pain.
            </li>
            <p>
              Further investigation is required to determine the cause of the
              pain.
            </p>
            <h2>Is There A Risk Involved?</h2>
            <li>
              Due to the relatively minor nature of injections, children are
              unlikely to experience any complications after receiving an
              injection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite the fact that no procedure is completely risk-free,
              infection may occur at the injection site.
            </li>
            <li>
              The injection may cause redness and itching if there is an
              allergic reaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Although this is not a serious condition, we must determine if
              there is an 1 allergic reaction before proceeding with treatment.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is likely that the injection site will initially feel painful,
              but this should only last a few days. The pain should be evaluated
              by a physician if it persists or becomes severe. The{" "}

              The child may be able to alleviate his or her symptoms of
              dizziness, fainting, or stiff neck following the injection by
              maintaining a positive attitude. Injection sites may develop a
              small area of baldness, approximately the size of a penny.
            </li>
            <li>
              Please keep an eye out for redness or heat at the injection site.
              If the injection site becomes red or feels hotter than the
              surrounding skin, please inform us.

            <p>
              As a result of an injection, the occipital nerve block reduces
              pain and inflammation around the nerve located at the base of the
              skull. A number of types of{" "}

              are caused by this condition. In spite of the general safety of
              occipital nerve blocks, their effectiveness and duration may
              differ significantly from person to person. An occipital nerve
              block may be recommended by a physician after other treatment
              options have been considered. Most patients are discharged from
              the hospital the same day following the procedure, which usually
              takes no more than a few minutes. In{" "}
