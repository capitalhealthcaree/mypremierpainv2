            <h4>Bursa Injection</h4>
            <p>
              If injections do not relieve your symptoms of bursitis, surgery
              may be necessary. Steroid injections may provide relief from
              bursitis symptoms including shoulder bursitis, hip bursitis, and
              other types of bursitis.
            </p>
            <h2>What is a Bursa Injection?</h2>
            <p>
              A bursa is a soft tissue that is located between two structures,
              such as bones, muscles, tendons, or skin. It is because of this
              space that structures may slide over each other. Several types of
              soft tissues surround and connect the body's internal organs and
              bones. Among the most common places to inject bursae are in the
              shoulders (the subacromial bursa) and in the hips (the
              trochanteric bursa). However, bursal injections can benefit other
              parts of the body as well. In the elbow, sacral bursas and
              olecranon bursae are common. Ultrasound commonly places a needle
              directly into the bursa. Local anesthesia is administered in
              conjunction with injections of corticosteroid ('cortisone' or
              'steroid').

            <h2>Bursa Injections Treat What Conditions?</h2>
            <p>
              Bursitis is an inflammation of the bursa occurring at multiple
              locations throughout the body. The most common places where
              bursitis occurs are the hips, shoulders, and knees. A painful
              sensation may be felt in the outer thigh, which is caused by
              inflammation of the trochanteric bursa, which is situated outside
              the hip. Pressure usually causes more severe pain leading to{" "}
              <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/joint-pain/" rel="preload">
                joint pain
              </Link>
              . Bursitis in the ischial region, also referred to as chronic
              ischiogluteal bursitis and Weaver's bottom. Symptoms include pain
              and inflammation of the bursa that surrounds the bones on which we
              sit. As a result, patients who sit down for extended periods of
              time typically complain of buttock pain.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the name suggests, pes anserine bursitis refers to an
              inflammation of the bursa on the inside of the knee. As a result
              of bursitis, the nearby tendons are irritated and are compressed.
              Typically, the pain is more severe while walking, and the knees
              and shin bones are the areas that are most affected. The
              subacromial bursa is affected by subacromial bursitis. The purpose
              of this bursa is to reduce friction between the shoulder bones and
              the rotator cuff tendons. Sleeping on the shoulder at night and
              using the arm above the head can exacerbate the pain.
            </p>
            <h2>When A Bursa Injection Is Performed, What Happens?</h2>
            <p>
              It is generally a quick procedure to administer a bursa injection,
              typically taking less than ten minutes to complete, says{" "}

              . You will be able to return home shortly after your healthcare
              provider administers an injection at sites such as the hip, knee,
              or shoulder by using ultrasound technology. Your provider will
              perform the following during a bursa injection:
            </p>
            <li>
              Provides assurance that the procedure you require is available at
              the location you have specified.
            </li>
            <li>Provides appropriate cleaning of the injection site.</li>
            <li>An anesthetic is applied to the skin in order to numb it.</li>
            <li>
              A thin needle is inserted into the skin in order to access an
              inflamed bursa sac.
            </li>
            <li>The bursa is injected with medications.</li>

              uses a fresh, sterilized needle for each injection when treating
              more than one bursa. As a result of the procedure,

              Recovery time following this procedure is relatively short.

              You may experience numbness following the injection for the first

              It may be possible for you to experience your usual symptoms more

              Steroids usually take 2-3 days to begin producing their beneficial
              effects. In some cases, they may take as long as 5-7 days. Please

              When a second injection is administered after the first injection
              has produced some pain relief, the effect of the second injection
              may be enhanced (known as "stacking"). A further injection may be
              required if your pain returns after a few weeks or months in order
              to enhance your pain relief.
            </li>

            <h2>What Are The Risks Associated With This Procedure?</h2>
            <p>Risks are rare. Among them are:</p>
            <li>Allergic reaction caused by medication</li>
            <li>Nerve damage</li>
            <li>Injection site bruising and bleeding</li>
            <li>
              Pain may occur at the injection site or during the injection

            <li>Acute infection</li>
            <li>Medication is injected into a blood vessel</li>
            <li>
              You may experience pain that does not improve or worsens in some
              cases
            </li>

              A temporary increase in blood sugar may also occur when diabetics

              What Is The Duration Of The Injection And How Long Will The
              Benefits Last?

            <p>
              As a general rule, the procedure takes approximately 10 minutes to
              complete, including preparation time. Immediately following
              treatment, you should be able to feel the benefits and relief from
              pain. Although it is difficult to determine how long and how much
              pain relief you will experience, it may last for several days or
              weeks. Several factors influence the outcome. Some patients do not
              receive any benefit from the procedure, while others may
              experience permanent relief. Your pain may be coming from the
              bursa injected today if you experience relief immediately
              following the procedure.

            <h2>A Note From Pain Management Fort Worth</h2>
            <p>
              Injections of bursae are an effective method of treating bursitis.
              Some cases include rehabilitation in addition to these
              interventions, depending on the location of the injury. A single
              injection can significantly reduce pain. To prevent bursitis from
              recurring, follow your healthcare provider's instructions. An
              individual with this condition may need to restrict activities
              that irritate the joint, depending on the severity of the
              condition. A supportive brace or sling may be necessary.
              Additionally, exercises that improve flexibility and strength may
              be beneficial. Several joints can experience inflammation of the
              tendons adjacent to the bursae. If your symptoms persist, you
              should discuss them with your physician. It may be necessary to
              undergo other therapies or surgery if the injections fail.
