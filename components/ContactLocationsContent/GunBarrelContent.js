        Many medical specialities focus on detecting and treating injuries and
        pathologies and treating symptoms and pain during recovery, but pain
        management is essential after the injury or disease has healed. If the
        cause is unknown, alleviating the discomfort is the goal. Most receivers
        are chronic pain patients. Chronic back pain and headaches necessitate
        treatment.

          Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and hypnosis have been used to
          alleviate pain, with mixed results. Although CBT improves mood, there
          is little data to indicate it decreases pain. Hypnosis studies are few
          but improving. Some think psychological treatments work because of the
          placebo effect.

          Joint pain physicians recommend medications including painkillers and
          anti-inflammatories. The location, severity, and likely source of pain
          determine the medicine. Over-the-counter medicines can treat mild
          pain, whereas opioids can treat severe pain following injury or
          surgery. NSAIDs and antidepressants are commonly recommended for
          fibromyalgia.
