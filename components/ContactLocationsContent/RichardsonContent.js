      <h2>What are the Main Pain Types?</h2>
      <p>
        All people have felt pain, but it's different. Some pain is temporary;
        others are permanent. Minutes or months can cure acute pain. Surgery,
        broken bones, cuts, and childbirth often cause it. Opioids, ice packs,
        heat packs, and physical therapy can treat acute pain. Chronic pain
        lasts over six months and is mild to severe daily. Chronic pain can
        lower quality of life without treatment. Depression or anxiety may
        result. Capsaicin cream, antidepressants, opioids, and
        nonpharmacological treatments can relieve pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nerve damage causes neuropathic pain. Pain may be stabbing, burning,
        shooting, or sharp. It can make hot, cold, and touch difficult. Cancer,
        alcoholism, stroke, amputation, chemotherapy, radiation, and diabetes
        can cause neuropathic pain. Damaged tissue causes nociceptive pain. A
        throbbing, sharp, or achy pain. Antidepressants, opioids, OTC medicine,
        and physical therapy can treat it.
