        treatment than a primary care doctor can provide, as individual needs
        differ. Following are the common pain conditions:

      </p>
      <h3>Healthcare Management</h3>
      <p>
        Based on a person's preferences, a doctor's competence, and other
        criteria like pain location and underlying illness, medical pain
        management can take several forms. Pain treatment doctors may provide
        drugs or injections. Medications prescribed may include opioids,
        steroids, antidepressants, and painkillers.
      </p>
      <h3>Injections</h3>
      <p>
        Opioids are familiar to pain management doctors. These potent
        painkillers can cause addiction and side effects. To determine how much
        and when to take drugs, a person should consult a pain management
        doctor.Following are the few injection treatments:

      <h3>Behavioral Treatment</h3>
