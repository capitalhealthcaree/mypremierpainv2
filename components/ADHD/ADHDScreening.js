                  Medical professionals diagnose in phases. The screening
                  process incorporates recommendations from the American
                  Psychiatric Association's DSM-5-TRâ„¢.

                    <li>
                      Rule out sleep disruptions, social issues, adjustment
                      disorders, and depression as reasons for the symptoms.
