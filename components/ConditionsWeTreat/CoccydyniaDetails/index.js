              Coccydynia has been misunderstood for a long time. Often called

              during the early 1900s. An injury or irritation of the tailbone
              (coccyx), a bony structure at the base of the spine, leads to this
              condition.

            <p>
              In some cases, the cause isn't known, but common causes include
              falls, infections during childbirth, or sitting on an
              uncomfortable surface for a long time. In addition to bone cancer,
              there's another type of cancer that spreads to the bones, called
              metastatic cancer. Backward falls, sitting on rigid surfaces for a
              long time, joint degeneration, pregnancy, and vaginal delivery can
              all cause tailbone pain. The fastest way to recover from your
              aches is to identify what is causing them as soon as possible.

            <h2>Causes of Tailbone Pain (Coccydynia)</h2>
            <p>
              An injury or other trauma usually results in{" "}

              , an inflammation of the tailbone. Occasionally, the tailbone may
              not be injured or traumatized, and this condition may occur on its
              own.
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Repetitive strain injury (RSI)</b>: The repetitive motion of
              leaning backwards and forwards in sports such as cycling and
              rowing can strain your coccyx's soft tissues.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Falling</b>: All of us have fallen backwards and onto our
              behinds at some point in our lives. If you leaned back too far in
              your office chair or slipped out of your feet on ice, you may have
              fallen. You may have fallen from a ladder. A severe fall may
              result in bruises, fractures, or dislocations of the tailbone
              (coccyx).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Obesity or Excessive Weight Loss</b>: As a result of excessive
              weight, the coccyx changes position. The tailbone rubs against
              surrounding tissues when a person is underweight, since the
              buttocks lack sufficient fat to prevent it from doing so. As a
              result, pain and inflammation result.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Underweight</b>: If your buttocks have insufficient fat, your
              coccyx may rub against your muscles, ligaments, and tendons.
              Rubbing causes soft tissues to become inflamed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pregnancy/Childbirth</b>: The body releases hormones during the
              third trimester that soften the sacrum-coccyx area, causing the
              coccyx to move during delivery. Although this is a natural
              process, it can cause additional pain because it stretches the
              ligaments and muscles around the coccyx. It results in strained
              soft tissues that are unable to properly support the coccyx.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Repetitive Strain</b>: Sporting activities such as cycling and
              rowing stretch the ligaments and tendons attached to the tailbone.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Falls</b>: When you fall on your buttocks, the tailbone may be
              bruised, broken, or dislocated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sitting</b>: Whenever possible, sit in a soft, more comfortable
              place and use a cushioned seat. Do not sit on a narrow or
              difficult surface. Get up frequently, stretch, and take a short
              walk every now and then.

              will likely diagnose you with{" "}

              may also perform tests to exclude conditions other than
              coccydynia. X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be
              ordered by your physician to determine whether you have fractured
              or broken a bone.
            </p>
            <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>

              if they persist for more than a few days. As well as coccydynia,
              several other conditions may cause similar symptoms, but may be
              more dangerous (such as tailbone fractures, hip fractures, and
              spinal fractures). In order to rule out other conditions or
              initiate treatment immediately, especially in more serious cases,
              it is imperative that you see your physician as soon as possible.
              If you experience any of the following symptoms and have tailbone
              pain, please contact your physician immediately:
            </p>
            <li>Swelling or pain that occurs suddenly</li>
            <li>Long-lasting constipation</li>
            <li>Legs become numb, weak, or tingly suddenly</li>
            <li>Constipation or urinary incontinence</li>
            <h2>Treatment of Coccydynia</h2>
            <p>
              Chronic tailbone pain can be treated using the following methods:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1- Physical Therapy:</b> In order to relax the pelvic floor,
              physical therapists may recommend breathing deeply and relaxing
              the pelvic floor in a similar manner to when you are urinating or
              defecating.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>2- Manipulation:</b> Generally, manipulation is performed
              through the rectum in order to relieve pain in the muscles
              attached to the tailbone.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              <b>3- Medicine:</b> Several weeks of pain relief can be achieved
              by injecting local anesthetic into the tailbone.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>4- Surgery:</b> Coccygectomy is the surgical removal of the
              coccyx. The general recommendation is to use this procedure when
              all other options have been exhausted.
