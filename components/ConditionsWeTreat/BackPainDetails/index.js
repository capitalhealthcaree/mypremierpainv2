						<h2>Main Causes</h2>
						<p>
							The back is made up of bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, discs,
							and a lot of flexion and extension joints. Spine discs cushion the
							vertebrae. Any of these issues can cause back pain. However, some
							causes of back pain are unknown. Strain, medical issues, and bad
							posture all cause damage. Back pain is often caused by stress,
							strain, or an injury. Back pain causes often include:
						</p>
						<h3>Problems With Structure</h3>
						<p>A number of structural issues can cause back pain, including:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Ruptured discs: Discs are responsible for cushioning each
								vertebra in the spine. Disc ruptures put pressure on nerves,
								causing back pain. The{" "}
								<Link href="https://g.co/kgs/C2XYzAR/" rel="preload">
									spine doctor near me{" "}
								</Link>
								can help in diagnosing ruptured discs and provide treatment for
								it.
							</li>
							<li>
								Bulging discs: Like ruptured discs, bulging disks can put nerve
								pressure on.
							</li>
							<li>
								Sciatica: sharp, shooting pain in the buttocks and back of the
								leg. This can happen when a large or herniated disk exerts
								pressure on a nerve or when a muscle specifically exerts
								pressure on the sciatic nerve.
							</li>
							<li>
								Arthritis: Osteoarthritis also affects other body joints.
								Sometimes the spinal cord space narrows. This is known as spinal
								stenosis by doctors.
							</li>
							<li>
								Osteoporosis: Brittle, porous bones, including spine vertebrae,
								increase compression fracture risk. It's possible for kidney
								stones or an infection to cause <b>back pain</b>.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Movement & Posture</h3>
						<p>
							Adopting a hunched posture while sitting at a computer can cause
							more back and shoulder problems over time. An{" "}
							<Link href="/contact-locations/hillsboro/" rel="preload">
								orthopedic spine specialist in Hillsboro{" "}
							</Link>
							can help in maintaining the proper posture to lessen the back
							pain. Back discomfort can also occur from bad posture or daily
							activity. Some examples are:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Twisting</li>
							<li>Coughing and sneezing</li>
							<li>Overstretching or awkward bending</li>
							<li>Prolonged pushing or pulling</li>
							<li>Neck strain</li>
							<li>Sleeping on an unsupportive mattress</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Additional Causes</h3>
						<p>Chronic conditions that can cause back pain are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Cauda equina syndrome: If you have cauda equina syndrome, you
								have a group of spinal nerve roots that come from the bottom of
								your spinal cord. Numbness, dull pain, and genitalia and thigh
								numbness are symptoms of this syndrome. Sometimes bowel and
								bladder issues emerge.
							</li>
							<li>
								Spinal cancer: Tumors can push on nerves, causing back pain.
								Tumors or metastases can cause bone-structural damage that is
								painful.
							</li>
							<li>
								Other infections: Back pain may also result from kidney or
								bladder infections and pelvic inflammatory disease.
							</li>
							<li>
								Shingles: Nerve infections can cause back pain. It depends on
								which nerves are impacted. Following the back pain, a rash will
								develop.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Assessment & Diagnosis</h2>
						<p>
							Your doctor or nurse will ask you about your symptoms and check
							out your body. In order to assess for fractures or other injuries,
							your provider may prescribe imaging studies. Your doctor can see
							your vertebrae, disks, muscles, ligaments, and tendons with these
							investigations. The following are things your provider can ask
							for:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Spine X-ray, which radiographs bones.</li>
							<li>
								MRI, which images bones, muscles, tendons, and other soft
								tissues using radio waves and a magnet,.
							</li>
							<li>
								CT scan, which creates 3D bones and soft tissue pictures using
								X-rays and a computer.
							</li>
							<li>
								Electromyography (EMG) is used to evaluate nerves and muscles
								for neuropathy, which can cause leg tingling or numbness.
							</li>
							<li>
								Blood tests can reveal genetic markers for back pain diseases
								such as ankylosing spondylitis. Urine tests detect kidney
								stones, which cause flank pain.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Back Pain Treatment</h2>

							If you are searching for a good{" "}
							<Link

							</Link>
							, you need to list down the pros and cons and tips for choosing
							the right doctor and treatment plan. Premier pain centers provide
							the best therapy plans according to your needs. Many people with
							discomfort don't need substantial <b>back pain treatment</b>.
							Over-the-counter painkillers usually work. In severe
							circumstances, heavier therapies may be needed, but your doctor
							will supervise them.
						</p>
						<h3>Rubs & Ointments</h3>
						<p>
							Topical back pain treatments may work well. Some{" "}
							<b>best back pain relief</b> products include:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Gels</li>
							<li>Lotions</li>
							<li>Creams</li>
							<li>Sprays</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Physical Treatment </h3>
						<p>
							Applying heat, cold, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and
							muscular release techniques to back muscles and soft tissues may
							relieve discomfort. Physical therapists may recommend back and
							abdominal flexibility and strength exercises as the pain improves.
							Posture-improvement techniques may help. Practice the techniques
							daily, even when the discomfort subsides, to prevent back pain.
						</p>
						<h3>Cortisone Shots</h3>
						<p>
							These may be administered into the spinal cord epidural space if
							other methods fail. Cortisone reduces inflammation. It reduces
							nerve root irritation. Pain-causing regions can be numbed by
							injections.
						</p>
						<h3>Surgery</h3>
						<p>
							Structural problems that haven't responded to medication and
							therapy usually require surgery.{" "}
							<Link href="https://advancedcaresurgerycenter.com/" rel="preload">
								Herniated disc surgery
							</Link>{" "}
							is best for back pain because it can relieve the pressure on
							nerves and can alleviate the pain. Medical conditions that may
							require surgery include:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Chronic pain with structural defects</li>
							<li>
								Nerve compression weakens muscles, whereas spinal cord
								compression restricts daily tasks.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Back Pain Prevention</h2>
						<p>
							These tips can relieve <b>back pain</b>. They can also prevent
							back discomfort. For better prevention of ongoing pain, it is
							better to consult a{" "}
							<Link href="/meet-our-team/william-moore-md/" rel="preload">
								back and spine specialist near me
							</Link>
							. Following are some of the preventive measures:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Carry fewer items: The weight of briefcases, laptop bags,
								suitcases, and purses can cause unnecessary stress and strain on
								your neck and spine. Reduce your load and utilize a backpack to
								spread the weight. If possible, use a wheeled bag to eliminate
								back strain.
							</li>
							<li>
								Enhance your strength: When you work out, your back and stomach
								muscles support you. In addition, strengthening them helps
								prevent back pain, strain, and damage. Incorporate core-focused
								strength training workouts into your weekly fitness regimen.
							</li>
							<li>
								Adjust your posture. Your spine may be subjected to unnecessary
								pressure and strain as a result of poor posture. This can cause
								pain and harm. Remind yourself often to sit up straight and roll
								back your shoulders if they are rounded.
							</li>
							<li>
								Stretch often: Daily routines can tire muscles and strain them.{" "}
								<b>Back pain management</b> entails stretching on a regular
								basis to increase muscle circulation and reduce back discomfort
								and injury.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Outlook</h2>
						<p>
							Back pain is frustrating and disrupts daily living. Many
							treatments can help you recover from back discomfort and resume
							regular activities. Back discomfort may go away on its own, but if
							you don't know the source, you should get therapy from a{" "}

							doctor. Relaxation may be necessary, or you may be able to work if
