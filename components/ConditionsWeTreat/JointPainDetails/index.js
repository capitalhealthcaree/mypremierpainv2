							Joint pain is a form of distress that impacts one or more joints
							in the body. A joint is the point where the extremities of two or
							more bones meet. For instance, your hip joint is the connection
							between your pelvic and thigh bones. Hands, feet, hips, knees, and
							spines often hurt. Consistent <b>joint pain </b>may be present or
							intermittent. You may experience stiff or aching joints. Movement
							and activity also help to relieve stiff joints in the morning. Too
							much activity can worsen pain.

						<h2>Signs & Symptoms</h2>

						<h2>Causes of Joint Pain</h2>
						<p>
							The most frequent causes of <b>joint pain</b> are:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Osteoarthritis: It is a prevalent form of arthritis that
								develops as a result of the gradual deterioration of the
								protective covering between the bones, known as cartilage. Your
								joints hurt and get stiff. Gradually, osteoarthritis develops
								beyond age 45.
							</li>
							<li>
								Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): This chronic condition causes joint
								discomfort and swelling. Your joints frequently distort
								(typically in the fingers and wrists).
							</li>
							<li>
								Gout: Gout is an agonizing condition in which acidic crystals
								from the body accumulate in the joint, resulting in serious pain
								and swelling. This commonly affects your big toe.
							</li>
							<li>
								Overuse Causes Bursitis: It is typically located in the elbow,
								shoulder, knee, or hip.
							</li>
							<li>
								Tendinitis: Tendinitis means inflammation of your tendons, which
								connect bone and muscle. Usually in the elbow, heel, or
								shoulder. It usually results from overuse.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Joint discomfort may also result from viral infections, rash, or
							fever. Fractures or twists can also hurt your joints and cause
							pain.
						</p>
						<h2>Common Joint Pain Sites</h2>
						<p>
							Anything can hurt, including your knees, hips, shoulders, fingers,
							and toes. Common actions are :
						</p>
						<h3>Hip Discomfort</h3>
						<p>
							It hurts where your thigh bone meets your pelvis. Hip discomfort
							can be caused by arthritis, a fall, bursitis, or hip anatomy. To
							reduce the pain doctors may use{" "}
							<Link href="/treatments/hip-joint-injections/" rel="preload">
								hip joint injections
							</Link>{" "}
							that can help alleviate the inflammation in the certain area.
							Depending on the cause, you may have hip discomfort inside or
							outside. Hip pain can radiate to the lower back. You may only
							notice hip discomfort when walking or lying on the uncomfortable
							joint at night.
						</p>
						<h3>Finger Joint Pain</h3>
						<p>
							That <b>joint pain</b> in your fingers might be arthritis,
							especially if they are also swollen and stiff. Common causes
							include finger sprains, strains, and mallet finger. The cause may
							lead to stiffness, soreness, throbbing, or an ache in the finger.
							Overuse of elbow muscles and tendons can cause tennis elbow.
							Tennis elbow often results from wrist and arm motions.{" "}
							<b>Best treatment for tennis elbow</b> includes rest, physical
							therapy, and surgery.
						</p>
						<h3>Knee Pain</h3>
						<p>
							Knees bear most of your weight. This is why these joints are
							easily injured. Pain can impair normal life. Your knee may hurt
							deep inside or on top, depending on the cause. Your knee may hurt
							only on one side or in the back. It may be felt throughout the
							joint.
						</p>
						<h3>Facet Joint Pain</h3>
						<p>
							Arthritis-like conditions of the spine, such as facet joint
							syndrome, can be a substantial cause of back and neck discomfort.
							Joint degeneration between spine bones causes it.{" "}

							can help in diagnosing and lessening the discomfort that is
							originating from the facet joints in the spine, often used for
							arthritis-like conditions.
						</p>
						<h2>Treatment</h2>
						<p>
							Joint pain can be managed, but not cured. OTC medication or daily
							activities may relieve the pain. Sometimes the discomfort
							indicates a medical issue that requires medicine or surgery.{" "}
							<b>Joint pain treatment</b> includes:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Simple at-Home Remedies: Your{" "}
								<Link href="/meet-our-team/william-moore-md/" rel="preload">

								several times a day. Taking a warm bath may also help.
							</li>
							<li>

								workout. Additionally, doing light stretching movements will
								also be beneficial. You should consult with a{" "}

								prior to initiating or maintaining any exercise regimen.
							</li>
							<li>

								reduce joint stress.
							</li>
							<li>
								Medications: NSAIDs or acetaminophen may help ease your pain.
								Both medications are accessible without a prescription; however,
								it may be required for heavier dosages. If you have stomach
								ulcers, kidney illness, or liver disease, ask the{" "}
								<Link href="/meet-our-team/rao-k-ali/" rel="preload">

							can also help alleviate pain and inflammation in sacroiliac
							joints. If drugs and physical therapy do not work, joint
							injections may help with joint pain relief.
						</p>
						<p>
							A 20-minute joint injection is followed by a brief recovery. The
							doctor will frequently employ x-rays to direct the incision to its
							designated location, thus ensuring its accuracy and efficacy.
							After injection, the anesthetic should work immediately. This
							impact is transient; you may feel discomfort and swelling later
							that day. The steroid will reduce inflammation and produce
							benefits within a few days.{" "}
