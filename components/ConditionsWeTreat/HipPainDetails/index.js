						<h2>What is Hip Pain?</h2>
						<p>
							Hips are able to endure repeated movement and abrasion. Its shape
							allows for fluid mobility, as it is the body's largest
							ball-and-socket joint. When you have hip pain, you feel pain in or
							around your hip joint. Two bones connect at a joint. The hip joint
							connects your femur to your pelvis. One of your largest joints,
							the hip, is used to move, support your weight, and balance.{" "}
							<b>Hip pain</b> can range from a little irritation to a serious
							medical concern that requires treatment. Your hip joint injury
							determines where you feel discomfort. If you experience hip
							discomfort, it may be caused by muscle, tendon, or ligament issues
							near your hip.
