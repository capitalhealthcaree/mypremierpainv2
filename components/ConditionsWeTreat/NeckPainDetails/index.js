							Neck pain is frequent. Poor posture, like hunching over a computer

							caused by osteoarthritis. Only rarely can neck pain indicate a
							more serious issue. If your neck hurts and your arms or hands feel
							numb or weak, or if you feel pain extending into your shoulder or
							arm, you need to see a{" "}

						<h2>Neck Pain Sign & Symptoms</h2>
						<p>
							Neck discomfort can vary in severity and duration. Neck discomfort
							is often intense and lasts days or weeks. Occasionally, it becomes
							persistent. Mild neck pain may not affect your daily life, but
							severe pain may disable you.Neck discomfort symptoms include:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Stiff neck: Many <b>neck pain</b> sufferers say their neck is
								“stiff” or “stuck.” The range of motion might be reduced by neck
								pain.
							</li>
							<li>
								Sharp pain: Localized neck discomfort may feel acute or
								“stabbing” in one region.
							</li>
							<li>
								Numbness or radiating pain: Your neck ache may affect your head,
								trunk, shoulders, and arms. If your neck pain is nerve
								compression, your arms or hands may feel numb, tingly, or weak.
								A pinched nerve can cause searing or severe neck pain that
								spreads down the arm. Talk to a{" "}
								<Link href="https://g.co/kgs/Zn4d87p/" rel="preload">
									neck pain specialist near me{" "}
								</Link>
								about this symptom.
							</li>
							<li>
								Headache: Neck pain might cause cervicogenic headaches.{" "}
								<Link href="/conditions-we-treat/headaches/" rel="preload">
									Headaches
								</Link>{" "}
								and neck pain may indicate a migraine.
							</li>
							<li>
								Palpating pain: Palpating your cervical spine may exacerbate
								neck pain.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Causes of Neck Pain</h2>
						<p>Many things might cause neck pain:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								{" "}
								As you age, normal wear and tear can cause cervical spine
								degeneration and pain. Neck pain can result from osteoarthritis
								and spinal stenosis. Over time, stress and repetitive movements
								can degrade spine disks, creating herniated disks or pinched
								nerves.
							</li>
							<li>
								Physical strain: Repetitive or vigorous neck exercises can cause
								stiffness and pain. Misaligned spines from poor posture, weak
								abdomen muscles, and being overweight can cause neck pain. Neck
								pain is often caused by prolonged computer screen use.
							</li>
							<li>
								Mental tension can induce neck discomfort and stiffness by
								tightening neck muscles. Many people contract these muscles when
								anxious or upset and don't know it until their neck hurts. It is
								important to consult with a{" "}
								<Link href="/contact-locations/ennis/" rel="preload">
									{" "}
									neck chiropractor in Ennis
								</Link>
								.
							</li>
							<li>
								Trauma and other injuries can harm the{" "}
								<Link href="/treatments/spinal-cord-stimulation/" rel="preload">
									spinal cord
								</Link>{" "}
								muscles, ligaments, disks, vertebrae joints, and nerves, thereby
								developing neck pain. Automobile accidents often induce
								whiplash, which causes neck pain.
							</li>
							<li>
								Other health issues: Neck pain can indicate meningitis,
								rheumatoid arthritis, or malignancy.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Some <b>neck and shoulder pain</b> symptoms may signal a nerve
							root or spinal cord infection, illness, or risk. Fever, chills,
							arm or leg pain or tingling, balance or coordination issues, and
							other symptoms may be “red flag” indications. For an accurate
							diagnosis and successful treatment, see a{" "}
							<Link
								href="/meet-our-team/rao-k-ali/"
								rel="preload"
							>
								neck doctor in Dallas
							</Link>
							. A hard fall or car crash can cause severe neck pain that
							requires emergency attention.
						</p>
						<h2>How To Relieve Neck Pain?</h2>
						<p>Most neck pain is best treated by:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Staying active and moving your neck frequently can help in neck
								pain relief. Adjust any activity that may be producing pain.
							</li>
							<li>Heat or ice packs might ease neck stiffness and soreness.</li>
							<li>
								Neck manipulation can temporarily relieve pain. Physical
								therapies like physiotherapy, chiropractic, osteopathy, and
								acupuncture are the best neck pain relief treatment options.
							</li>
							<li>
								Resting is one of the best neck strain treatments. Muscles
								stiffen without movement. The discomfort will last longer.
								Gentle neck stretching is best.
							</li>
							<li>
								If your neck pain persists, your{" "}
								<Link href="/contact-locations/hillsboro/" rel="preload">
									neck pain doctor in Hillsboro
								</Link>{" "}
								will explore. In some cases, neck spine surgery or steroid
								injections relieve severe neck pain.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							According to the best{" "}
							<Link href="/" rel="preload">
								back and neck clinic in Dallas
							</Link>
							, neck pain can be managed by following these points:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Comfortable, supportive pillows are essential. Sleep on one
								solid support pillow instead of softer ones to reduce neck
								strain.
							</li>
							<li>
								Adjust your workplace to meet your needs. A footstool may help
								level your hips and knees. If you talk a lot, request a headset.
								This will prevent constant neck bending. Adjusting your computer
								screen height may help you minimize neck strain. Keep books at
								eye level to avoid slouching.
							</li>
							<li>Practice yoga or Pilates to enhance your posture.</li>
							<li>
								Wearing neck supports (braces and collars) is not advised unless
								your{" "}
								<Link href="/contact-locations/richardson/" rel="preload">
									neck dr in Richardson
								</Link>{" "}
								says so.
							</li>
						</ul>

							Your neck's vital role is often overlooked unless you develop neck
							pain or problems moving your head. The average human head weighs
							10 pounds. The neck supports this weight and aligns the head with
							the body. This work may harm your body, especially if you strain
							your neck. Good posture and frequent stretching can prevent{" "}
							<b>neck pain</b> problems. Consult a{" "}
							<Link href="https://g.co/kgs/k4fyPJB/" rel="preload">
								neck specialist near me
							</Link>{" "}
							for neck pain. They recommend relief drugs and therapies.
