						<h2>Common Types of Headaches</h2>
						<p>
							There are over 150 types of headaches, with the following being
							the most common:
						</p>
						<h3>Headaches from Tension</h3>
						<p>
							Adults and teens get tension headaches most often. They cause
							occasional mild-to-severe pain. Headaches from migraines.
							Migraines hurt like hammers. They last 4 hours to 3 days and occur
							individually. They experience pain in addition to other symptoms,
							such as:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Light, noise, or scent sensitivity</li>
							<li>Nausea, vomiting</li>
							<li>Appetite loss</li>

						</blockquote>
						<h3>Chronic Daily Headaches</h3>
						<p>
							Chronic headaches last 15 days or more for over 3 months. A few
							are short. Some endure more than 4 hours. Typically, one of the
							four basic headache types is:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Long-term migraine</li>
							<li>Chronic tension headaches</li>
							<li>Hemicrania continua</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Sinus Pain Headache</h3>
						<p>
							Sinus headaches cause persistent pain in your cheekbones,
							forehead, or nose bridge. They occur when the sinuses inflame.
							Sinus symptoms, including a runny nose, full ears, fever, and
							puffy cheeks, often accompany the pain. Cluster and{" "}
							<b>migraine</b> headaches have clear discharge, whereas a sinus
							infection causes yellow or green nasal discharge.
						</p>
						<h3>Causes of Headache</h3>
						<p>
							A headache can cause pain in one or more places on the head.
							Multiple pain types result from headaches. Classifying pain helps
							doctors diagnose it.
							<Link href="/contact-locations/plano/" rel="preload">
								{" "}
								Headache doctors in Plano
							</Link>{" "}
							also classify headaches by underlying health conditions.
						</p>
						<h3>Primary Headaches</h3>
						<p>
							A primary headache is not an indication of illness. Head and neck
							issues produce these headaches. Possible causes of primary
							headaches include overactivity or issues in pain-sensitive systems
							such as brain areas, blood vessels, muscles, and nerves. Cluster,
							tension, migraine, and drug misuse headaches are common primary
							headache syndromes.
						</p>
						<h3>Secondary Headaches</h3>
						<p>
							This headache indicates a medical issue. A secondary headache may
							be caused by:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Pregnant women may experience systemic problems like infections.
							</li>
							<li>Hypothyroidism</li>
							<li>Giant cell arteritis, stroke, brain tumor.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>How are Headache Causes Determined?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Maintaining a headache diary in the weeks before your
								consultation is important. It can track headache frequencies and
								triggers.
							</li>
							<li>In your diary, record the number of headache days.</li>
							<li>
								Consider the severity of your headache, associated symptoms, and
								possible triggers.
							</li>
							<li>
								Tell the doctor at the
								<Link href="https://g.co/kgs/vuXVVVz/" rel="preload">
									{" "}
									migraine clinic near me
								</Link>{" "}
								how your headache impacts your family, career, and daily life.
							</li>
							<li>
								In most circumstances, testing is unnecessary. If your doctor
								feels that another medical condition is causing headaches, they
								may use the following sequence:
							</li>
							<li>Check with your optometrist for eye and blood testing.</li>
							<li>A head CT or MRI scan a lumbar puncture</li>
							<li>
								Neurologists diagnose and treat brain, spinal cord, and nerve
								disorders. Your doctor may refer you.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>How do I Treat Headaches?</h2>
						<p>There are many strategies to prevent or treat headaches.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Maintaining hydration while reducing alcohol.</li>
							<li>
								Make sure you get enough sleep and refrain from watching TV or
								using laptops before bed.
							</li>
							<li>Small caffeine intake.</li>
							<li>Apply eye or head cold packs.</li>
							<li>A heated bath or shower.</li>
							<li>Rest in a calm, dark room.</li>
							<li>
								Practice relaxation techniques like mindfulness, breathing,
								lavender oil, meditation, or yoga.
							</li>
							<li>
								Evaluate the effectiveness of acupressure, acupuncture, massage,{" "}
								<Link href="/tms-therapy/" rel="preload">
									TMS therapy
								</Link>
								, osteopathic, or chiropractic treatments.
							</li>
							<li>
								Use paracetamol, ibuprofen, or aspirin for pain. Children under
								18 cannot use aspirin.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>When Should You See a Doctor?</h2>
						<p>
							If your <b>headaches</b> are regular and restrict you from
							accomplishing tasks, visit a doctor. If you get headaches more
							than three times a week, you should see a doctor. Discuss your
							headaches with your doctor if they intensify. If you have cancer,
							a weak immune system, or a history of blindness in your family,
							you should see a{" "}
