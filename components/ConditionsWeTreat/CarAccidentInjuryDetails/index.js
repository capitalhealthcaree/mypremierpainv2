							Anytime a car accident happens, it terrifies everyone.

							impair your physical, emotional, and financial wellbeing. Car
							accidents caused 5.4 million medically-consulted injuries in 2021,

						<h2>Car Accident Injury Types</h2>
						<p>Following are a few types of car accident injuries:</p>
						<h3>Whiplash</h3>
						<p>
							Whiplash is a typical car accident injury. Moving your neck
							quickly forward and backward can strain or sprain the muscles and
							ligaments that hold it together. Different people with whiplash
							have different signs. Among these are:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Neck pain: Whiplash can make your neck hurt a little or a lot.
							</li>
							<li>
								The pain may be intense, preventing neck or head movement.
							</li>
							<li>
								Stiffness is another typical symptom that can cause discomfort
								and mobility issues.
							</li>
							<li>
								Whiplash can cause moderate-to-severe{" "}

									headaches
								</Link>
								.
							</li>
							<li>
								Whiplash can cause dizziness, which can impair balance and
								increase fall risk.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Whiplash pain is often treated with medication. Physical therapy
							recommended by pain management doctors in Dallas helps reduce neck
							stiffness and enhance range of motion. Restoring spine alignment
							with chiropractic therapy can also relieve symptoms. Chronic pain
							and other symptoms can persist for months or years after a
							whiplash injury. If you have these symptoms after an accident, see
							a

						<h3>Internal Injuries</h3>

							management in Dallas right away because internal injuries can be

								{" "}
								auto accident injury physicians
							</Link>{" "}
