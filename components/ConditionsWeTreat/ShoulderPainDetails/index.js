							<b>Shoulder pain</b> is any form of distress or pain that you
							experience in your shoulder. Shoulders are ball-and-socket joints.
							It is the body's most mobile joint. Your shoulder fuses with your
							humerus, scapula, and collarbone. The round hole on the scapula is
							the right size for the humerus. Each shoulder has a rotator cuff,
							a group of four muscles and tendons that protects the humerus and
							allows arm movement. The rotator cuff is responsible for shoulder
							motion.

						<h2>Source of Shoulder Pain</h2>
						<p>
							Several conditions can cause shoulder pain. Rotator cuff
							tendinitis causes the majority of cases. An additional prevalent
							source of shoulder discomfort is impingement syndrome, which
							occurs when the rotator cuff becomes entrapped between the humeral
							head and the acromion. Shoulder pain might stem from neck or
							biceps damage. Referred pain is the term used to describe this
							phenomenon. Shoulder movement rarely worsens referred discomfort.
						</p>
						<p>
							Bones are held together by muscles, and the head of the humerus is
							padded inside the joint by a fluid-filled sac. Your shoulder may
							hurt for several reasons due to its multiple parts.{" "}
							<b>Shoulder pain</b> can be caused by arthritis. Referred pain
							might come from other parts of your body. Different shoulder
							discomfort sources include:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Arthritis and cartilage damage</li>
							<li>Rotator cuff injury</li>
							<li>Bulging bursa, sacs, or tendons</li>
							<li>Bone spurs</li>
							<li>Shoulder or neck pinched nerve</li>
							<li>Broken shoulder or arm bone frozen</li>
							<li>Overuse can cause shoulder dislocations.</li>
							<li>Spinal cord damage</li>
							<li>A heart attack</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Doctor's Examination</h2>
						<p>
							If you have a serious injury that is causing a lot of pain, you
							should see a{" "}
							<Link href="/contact-locations/ennis/" rel="preload">
								shoulder injury doctor in Ennis
							</Link>{" "}
							right away. Rest for a few days if the discomfort is mild to see
							if it goes away. Consult{" "}
							<Link href="/meet-our-team/" rel="preload">
								pain physicians in Dallas
							</Link>{" "}
							if symptoms persist. In order to ascertain the source of your
							shoulder discomfort and offer you treatment alternatives,{" "}
							<Link href="/" rel="preload">
								pain management in Dallas
							</Link>{" "}
							will set up a thorough assessment.
						</p>
						<h3>A Medical History</h3>
						<p>
							The evaluation begins with a complete medical history. A{" "}
							<Link href="/contact-locations/plano/" rel="preload">
								shoulder pain specialist in Plano
							</Link>{" "}
							can help you by checking your previous medical history and then
							evaluating your underlying symptoms to develop a treatment plan.
							The doctor may inquire:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Pain onset and timing</li>
							<li>Previous pain and treatment</li>
							<li>
								Other inquiries to assess your health and shoulder issue reasons
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							A medical history might help diagnose shoulder discomfort because
							most shoulder disorders are worsened and alleviated by certain
							activities.
						</p>
						<h3>Physical Checkup</h3>
						<p>
							A thorough exam is needed to diagnose shoulder pain. During your
							appointment, your doctor will:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Check for anomalies, edema, deformities, and muscle weakness.
							</li>
							<li>Check for tender spots.</li>
							<li>Check your shoulder strength and range of motion.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Evaluations and Tests</h3>
						<p>
							Your doctor may request tests to diagnose your pain and other
							issues. A{" "}
							<Link href="/contact-locations/hillsboro/" rel="preload">
								shoulder pain treatment in Hillsboro
							</Link>{" "}
							can assist you with evaluation tests, assess your condition, and
							diagnose the source of pain. Some of them are:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>X-rays: X-rays indicate shoulder bone damage.</li>
							<li>
								MRI and ultrasound: Images from these examinations are better
								than those from soft tissue X-rays. Doctors may use MRI to
								detect shoulder ligament and tendon problems.
							</li>
							<li>
								CT scan: A CT scan uses both X-rays and computers to give a very
								clear picture of the bones in the shoulder area.
							</li>
							<li>
								Testing for electrodiagnosis: Your physician may prescribe an
								electromyography (EMG) examination to assess nerve function.
							</li>
							<li>
								Arthrogram: An X-ray study uses dye put into the shoulder to
								make the joint and muscles and tendons around it easier to see.
								Additionally, it could be put together with an MRI or CT scan.
							</li>
							<li>
								Arthroscopy: Your surgeon uses a fiber-optic camera to examine
								the joint. An arthroscopy may reveal soft tissue injuries that
								were not noticeable during a physical check, X-rays, or other
								tests. Arthroscopy can diagnose and cure pain.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Treatment for Shoulder Pain</h2>
						<p>
							Shoulder displacements, breaks, and fractures need medical help to
							put them back in the right place, and then a sling is used to keep
							them there while they heal. While you're resting, using heat or
							ice and taking an aspirin or ibuprofen-type medicine to lower the
							pain and stiffness may help with many other problems. Following
							these first steps may not help your shoulder:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Your doctor may try putting an anti-inflammatory drug called a
								corticosteroid directly into the joint to reduce pain and
								swelling.
							</li>
							<li>
								Rest and medication don't always help cartilage, the rotator
								cuff, or frozen shoulder tears. Your doctor may suggest surgery.
							</li>
							<li>

							</li>
							<li>
								Your shoulder problem treatment will likely include exercises to
								stretch, strengthen, and enhance range of motion.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							No shoulder pain therapy is specific because it depends on the
							injury.
						</p>
						<h3>Shoulder Dislocation</h3>
						<p>
							Dislocated shoulders must be reinserted immediately to avoid
							complications. A confined reduction, or manipulation, is the most
							prevalent treatment. This must be done in the ER since doing it
							yourself can cause greater damage. A{" "}
							<Link href="/contact-locations/richardson/" rel="preload">
								shoulder pain doctor in Richardson
							</Link>{" "}
							and another medical expert manually realign your arm and shoulder.
							The procedure is uncomfortable, so you may need sedation.
						</p>
						<p>
							To prevent the shoulder from dislocating again, wear a sling to
							keep it in place and prevent your arm from dragging on it. Ice and
							over-the-counter painkillers may help. You may need physical
							therapy. If you're looking for a{" "}
							<Link href="https://g.co/kgs/a2WuUzw/" rel="preload">
								shoulder pain specialist near me
							</Link>
							, Premier Pain Centers is the best choice because they can help
							you move your arm to avoid shoulder stiffness. To safeguard your
							shoulder, therapy strengthens the surrounding muscles. If closed
							reduction fails, surgery may be needed to reposition it.
						</p>
						<h3>Separated Shoulder</h3>
						<p>
							A split shoulder usually simply requires a sling, ice packs, and
							painkillers. You will also likely require physical rehabilitation,
							and your physician will inform you of the appropriate time to
							begin lifting heavy weights or lifting above your head. Shoulder
							separation surgery is rare, although extreme separations may
							require it.
						</p>
						<h3>Broken Shoulder</h3>
						<p>
							A fractured shoulder will often recover with a sling. However,
							shoulder fractures may require surgery to fix the bones and
							additional damage. The{" "}
							<Link href="https://g.co/kgs/a2WuUzw/" rel="preload">
								best doctor for shoulder pain near me
							</Link>{" "}
							may consider arthroplasty for a serious fracture. The rotator cuff
							ruptures. The severe rotator cuff pain can only be fixed through
							surgery. However, not all tears need to be fixed. A good{" "}
							<Link
								href="/meet-our-team/rao-k-ali/"
								rel="preload"
							>
								orthopedic doctor for shoulder pain{" "}
							</Link>
							may prescribe NSAIDs, physical therapy, or steroid shots for small
							tears.
						</p>
						<p>
							Other injuries mostly. Rest, NSAIDs, and physical therapy are the
							first-line treatments for most shoulder problems. A{" "}
							<Link href="/meet-our-team/rao-k-ali/" rel="preload">
								shoulder pain doctor in Dallas
							</Link>{" "}
							may prescribe cortisone. If these fail, surgery may be needed.
						</p>
						<h2>Why is Recovery Needed?</h2>
						<p>
							Your shoulders allow you to move your arms in several directions
							and are heavily used. Due to their prolonged utilization, it is
							feasible to sustain either one or both injuries. It's possible to
							treat most shoulder pain at home as long as they don't get worse,
							especially if they were caused by overuse. However, shoulder
							dislocations and fractures require medical treatment. A shoulder
							ache doesn't always indicate a problem. Sometimes it indicates a
							heart attack.
