							Knee pain affects people of all ages. Tears in ligaments or
							cartilage can make the knee hurt. <b>Knee pain</b> can be caused
							by arthritis, gout, or an illness. You can take care of acute knee
							pains yourself. Knee braces and physical treatment can help ease
							the pain. But you might need knee surgery.
						</p>
						<h2>Causes of Knee Pain</h2>
						<p>
							Knee problems include tears, sprains, and strains. Sports injuries
							can cause knee discomfort. Physical activity is best for your
							joints and body. An injury can occur, often to the knees. Sprained
							ligaments, meniscus tears, tendonitis, and runner's knee are
							prevalent. An untreated knee injury may flare up sometimes or hurt
							all the time. It can be caused by injury, overuse, aging,
							arthritis, or other problems. Physical activity is best for your
							joints and body.
						</p>
						<p>Following are the few causes of knee pain:</p>
						<h3>Knee Injury</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Back of knee pain</b> can result from several injuries.
							Strains, sprains, ligament tears (like the ACL), cartilage tears,
							and fractures are examples. Landing wrong, falling, twisting the
							knee, or being smacked on the knee can cause them. Swelling around
							the injury causes the most pain.
						</p>
						<h3>Physical Issues or Overuse</h3>
						<p>
							Knee discomfort can result from aging, obesity, and hard exercise.
							Overuse hurts. Running, jumping, and other knee-pressure workouts
							might cause them over time. Sometimes called “runner’s knee.”
						</p>
						<h3>Patellar Tendinitis</h3>
						<p>
							This indicates inflammation in the kneecap-shinbone tendon. Strong
							tendons connect muscles to bones. Overexercising might inflame and
							irritate them. The most prevalent cause is repetitive leaping,
							such as from basketball, hence the name “jumper's knee.”.
						</p>
						<h3>IT Band Syndrome </h3>
						<p>
							The tight iliotibial (IT) band stretches from your hip to your
							outer knee. Overactivity can cause inflammation. That produces
							outer knee soreness. This is typical among runners, especially
							downhill.
						</p>
						<h3>Tendonitis</h3>
						<p>
							Knee pain could be a sign of tendinitis. A muscle hurts and swells
							up after being hurt.
						</p>
						<h3>Osgood-Schlatter</h3>
						<p>
							The lump of bone below your kneecap hurts and swells when you
							exercise and when you don't. This is because you have
							Osgood-Schlatter's disease.
						</p>
						<h3>Knee Discomfort</h3>
						<p>
							Children and young adults often have this knee condition.
							Patellofemoral pain syndrome causes kneecap pain. Stairs, jogging,
							squatting, cycling, and knee-flexed sitting cause pain. Patients
							with this illness are often prescribed exercise.
						</p>
						<h2>How Does a Knee Injury Feel?</h2>
						<p>
							The pain is obvious! However, the condition can affect the type
							and location of pain. Maybe you have:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Knee pain, especially when bending or straightening the knee
								(including descending stairs),
							</li>
							<li>Swelling</li>
							<li>Knee weight-bearing problems</li>
							<li>Leg movement issues</li>
							<li>Knee “locking”</li>
							<li>
								See a{" "}
								<Link
									href="/meet-our-team/dr-muhammad-zulqarnain-dr-z-/"

								</Link>{" "}
								for these symptoms. Your knee will be examined. X-rays or MRIs
								may be needed to see the joint more clearly.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Knee Pain Treatment</h2>
						<p>
							Treatment for knee pain depends on its cause. A{" "}
							<Link href="https://g.co/kgs/Zn4d87p/" rel="preload">
								knee pain specialist near me
							</Link>{" "}
							will recommend therapies based on pain degree and reason.
						</p>
						<h3>RICE Knee Pain Treatment</h3>
						<p>
							Knee pain is commonly treated at home using RICE that is a{" "}
							<b>knee treatment without surgery</b>:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Stop the painful activity to avoid aggravating the injury.
							</li>
							<li>
								Use an ice pack or cold rub on your wound for 15 to 20 minutes
								every hour for the first day after it happened. After one day,
								put ice on it every three to four hours. Cover the ice pack with
								a towel or rag so that it doesn't touch your skin.
							</li>
							<li>
								Compression lowers swelling and blood flow to your wounded knee.
								Wrap your knee with a compression bandage. Medical professionals
								can help you safely wear a compression wrap.
							</li>
							<li>
								{" "}
								Elevation: Keep your knees above your heart. You can support
								your knee with pillows, blankets, or cushions.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Medicines for Knee Pain</h3>
						<p>
							Your doctor may prescribe drugs for knee pain relief. Ibuprofen,
							aspirin, naproxen, and acetaminophen are available
							over-the-counter for most people.
						</p>
						<h3>Knee Braces</h3>
						<p>
							A knee brace is one of the best knee treatments near you that
							stabilizes your knee. Knee braces align the knees. Strong plastic
							or metal with cushions and knee-and-leg straps are typical. Your
							provider will recommend a brace and how often to wear it.
						</p>
						<h3>Physiotherapy</h3>
						<p>
							Your{" "}
							<Link href="/meet-our-team/william-moore-md/" rel="preload">
								doctor for knee pain
							</Link>{" "}
							may recommend physical therapy for arthritis or injury recovery.
							Physical therapists will teach you knee-strengthening exercises.
							This improves stability and reduces pain.
						</p>
						<h3>Knee Surgery</h3>
						<p>
							Not everyone with knee pain needs knee or{" "}
							<b>joint replacement surgery</b>. If the pain is severe and
							previous therapies have failed,{" "}
							<Link href="/" rel="preload">
								pain management in Dallas
							</Link>{" "}
							may recommend it. Severe arthritis, ligament damage, or bone
							fractures may require surgery. The most common knee operation is
							arthroscopy. The arthroscope's camera and light allow your surgeon
							to examine and repair knee injuries.
						</p>
						<p>
							You may need <b>knee replacement surgery</b>. The surgeon will
							insert a prosthetic in your knee. If <b>knee pain</b> and other
							issues impair standing, walking, and moving, your doctor may
							consider a knee replacement. Your surgeon at the{" "}
							<Link href="https://g.co/kgs/k12KsWd/" rel="preload">
								knee clinic near me{" "}
							</Link>
							will recommend a whole or partial knee replacement. The cause of
							the discomfort and the injured knee portions determine the surgery
							you need.
