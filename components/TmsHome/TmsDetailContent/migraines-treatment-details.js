            <h2>What's a Migraine?</h2>
            <p>
              Migraines are serious headaches that cause throbbing, pulsing
              discomfort on one side. Migraine headaches last days but at least
              four hours. This headache worsens with:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Physical exertion</li>
              <li>Bright lights</li>
              <li>Loud noises</li>
              <li>Strong smells</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Your everyday routine and personal and social duties may be
              affected. Migraines can be treated. A migraine goes beyond a

                headache
              </Link>
              . A debilitating, throbbing, one-sided headache might keep you in
              bed for days. Sensitivity, movement, lighting, sound, and other
              cues could cause visual disturbances, nausea, malaise,
              irritability, and more.

            <h2>What Migraine Types Exist?</h2>
            <p>
              There are many migraine varieties. The most common migraine types
              include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Migraine with aura (classic migraine)</li>
              <li>Common migraine (no aura)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before head pain, migraines have auras.</p>
            <p>Other types of migraines include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Long-term migraine</li>
              <li>Hemiplegic migraine</li>
              <li>Period headache</li>
              <li>Headache-free migraine</li>
              <li>Retinal migraine</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How are Migraines Treated?</h2>
            <p>
              No cure exists for migraines. However, a neurologist for migraine
              can assist in treating migraine symptoms. A doctor may prescribe
              migraine medicine. There are two drug types:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Antidepressant medicines: These drugs can be consumed when a
                headache starts. They soothe sensitivity, migraine discomfort,
                vomiting, and more.
              </li>
              <li>
                Preventive medicines: Your doctor might recommend preventive
                medicines for chronic migraine treatment if you have
                debilitating symptoms that interfere with your schedule or
                regular migraines. These medicines reduce the frequency and
                intensity of migraines. Every day, these medicines could be used
                as directed.

              directions is absolutely vital. For moderate migraines mild to
              moderate ones, over-the-counter migraine medicines are effective
              and are emergency migraine treatment. Among the ingredients in
              painkillers are aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, and
              caffeine. Use OTC painkillers cautiously. Overuse can produce

            <h3>Other Migraine Treatments</h3>
            <p>
              Besides medical care, some patients find alleviation with
              alternative therapies such as counseling. These are alternative or
              complementary treatments. Migraine includes:
            </p>

                that may cause symptoms. Biofeedback can stop a slow-starting
                headache.
              </li>
              <li>

                botanicals help to relieve migraines or even stop them.

              may warn against migraine drugs if you think you could be
              expecting. Some drugs may endanger fetuses. Sometimes, doctors

            <h2>Avoid Migraine Causes</h2>
            <p>
              Medical professionals can assist you in identifying migraine
              triggers. They may require a migraine diary. Migraine journals can
              help you record migraine dates, symptoms, and duration. You can
              also list your diet and activities to identify triggers.
              Smartphone apps can help you record migraines. After finding a
              trigger, you can avoid it. Although this isn't always possible,
              knowing your triggers helps you treat migraines. Since stress may
              set off something, you may want to consult a mental health
              specialist. If you get migraines when you skip a meal, schedule
              phone alerts for regular eating.
