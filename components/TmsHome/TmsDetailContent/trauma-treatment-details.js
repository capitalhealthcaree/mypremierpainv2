              Trauma can be the result of an accident, crime, natural disaster,
              physical or emotional abuse, neglect, viewing or living in war,
              watching or experiencing the death of a loved one, and more. Right
              after, people usually feel stunned and in disbelief. Extended
              impacts encompass flashbacks, erratic moods, challenging
              relationships, and physical symptoms such as headache or stomach
              upset. Though these emotions are typical, some individuals find it
              difficult to let go.{" "}

            <h2>Categories of Trauma</h2>
            <p>
              Like an accident, rape, or natural disaster, the American
              Psychological Association (APA) defines trauma as "an emotional
              response to a terrible event." An event, either physically or
              emotionally agonizing, can result in trauma. Trauma can cause both
              long-term as well as immediate emotions. People who are shocked,
              desperate, or tense will have difficulty making sense of their
              encounters. Physical symptoms can result from trauma. Untreated
              symptoms of trauma can lead to PTSD, therefore it is very
              necessary to get emergency trauma care in Texas.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Acute trauma results from one taxing or hazardous event.</li>
              <li>
                Repeated, intense stress leads to chronic trauma. Among these
                are domestic violence, bullying, and child abuse.
              </li>
              <li>Complex trauma results from many traumas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Others might go vicariously traumatized. Close contact with
              someone traumatized, in this case, triggers trauma indicators.
              Others who look after victims of trauma and family may suffer
              vicarious trauma. There could be PTSD symptoms.
            </p>

            <p>
              Trauma is an emotional response to a stressful incident. After a
              stressful experience, this emotional response may last or be
              brief. Child abuse could still be happening, or an individual
              might go through complex trauma—that is, several traumatic events.
              Under stress, people may experience guilt, changes in behaviour,
              mood swings, sleeplessness, helplessness, anxiety, irritability,
              rapid heart rate, and body aches and pains. Individuals
              traumatized could develop PTSD and kill themselves. Are you
