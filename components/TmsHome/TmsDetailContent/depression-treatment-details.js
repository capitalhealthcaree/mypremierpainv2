            <h2>What is Depression?</h2>
            <p>
              Depression causes long-term unhappiness and a lack of interest in
              once-cherished pastimes. It can affect eating, sleeping, recall,
              and thought.

              Loss of work or divorce is something reasonable to mourn.
              Depression has other symptoms and lasts nearly daily for at least
              two weeks; unlike sadness, it does. Depression comes in many
              forms. Some refer to clinical anxiety or major depressive disorder
              as "depression." A common mental disease, depression causes
              enduring grief and alterations in behavior, eating, sleeping, and
              thought. Depression{" "}

              Psychiatric Association:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Major depression: Major depressive disorder is when you feel
                hopeless, down, or sad every day for at least two weeks and have
                other symptoms, including sleep disturbances, loss of activity
                interest, or food cravings. This is depression's most relentless
                and serious form.
              </li>

                depression is persistent depressive illness. It is much less
                severe than major depression. Dysthymia was what healthcare

                and depression with PMS symptoms. These symptoms may be
                life-changing, although they clear within a few days once your
                period starts.
