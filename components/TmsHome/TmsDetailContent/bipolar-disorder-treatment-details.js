              <span>Bipolar Disorder</span>
            </h2>
            <p>
              A lifelong mental health ailment, bipolar disorder causes drastic
              changes in mood, energy, thought, and behavior. These changes
              could interfere with daily chores for hours, days, weeks, or even
              years. Some forms of bipolar disorder result in hypomania/mania
              and melancholy episodes. Usually, bipolar disorder does not
              trigger more than does not provoke hypomania or depression. They
              also go through euthymic.
            </p>
            <h2>Bipolar Disorder Symptoms</h2>
            <p>
              Bipolar disorder symptoms vary, per NAMI. An episode may persist
              for days or weeks in some individuals. Bipolar disorder patients
              often go long periods without symptoms. Others may have
              simultaneous or rapid “highs” and “lows.” Mixed states emerge when
              these mood episodes occur together. Rapid cycling occurs when they
              happen quickly.
            </p>
            <h3>Hypomania/Mania</h3>
            <p>
              Hypomania and mania are high moods. Hypomania is less intense than
              mania.
            </p>
            <p>Symptoms may include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li aria-level="1">Increased energy and activity.</li>
              <li aria-level="1">
                Restlessness, “high” mood, racing thoughts, rapid speech, and
                acute irritation.
              </li>
              <li aria-level="1">
                Concentration issues, reduced sleep, and false self-confidence.
              </li>
              <li aria-level="1">Sex desire raised</li>
              <li aria-level="1">
                Destructive, aggressive, or dangerous behaviors, denying
                possible problems
              </li>
              <li aria-level="1">
                Bipolar disorder patients may spend a lot of money, use drugs,
                drink, and do unsafe things
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What Sorts of Bipolar Disorder?</h2>
            <p>Four bipolar disorder kinds include:</p>
            <ol>
              <li aria-level="1">
                One or more mania episodes characterize bipolar I disorder. Most
                bipolar I patients experience mania and depression, but
                depression isn't necessary for diagnosis. Two weeks are typical
                for depressive episodes. Bipolar I is diagnosed when manic
                episodes last at least seven days or require hospitalization.
                Bipolar I patients might also have mixed depression and mania.
              </li>
              <li aria-level="1">
                Depressive and hypomanic episodes characterize bipolar II
                disorder. They never have a full bipolar I manic episode.
                Chronic depression makes bipolar II disorder more debilitating
                than bipolar I disorder, even though hypomania is less
                disabling.
              </li>
              <li aria-level="1">
                People with cyclothymic disorder have chronically unpredictable
                moods. At least two years of hypomania and mild depression.
                Cyclothymia patients may experience short euthymia lasting less
                than eight weeks. Mental health services for bipolar can help to
                treat every type of bipolar disorder.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li aria-level="1">
                Other specified or unverified bipolar disorders are cases in
                which an individual has very significant abnormal mood elevation
                but does not qualify under the standards of bipolar I, II, or
                cyclothymia.&nbsp;
              </li>

            <h2>Bipolar Disorder Treatments</h2>
            <p>
              Bipolar disorder diagnosis in Ennis TX &nbsp;helps many, including
              individuals with severe bipolar disorder. Education, early symptom
              recognition, and trigger identification are self-management
              measures. Effective lifestyle habits include yoga, meditation, and
              exercise. Other therapies, such as{" "}

              and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), for poorly responsive
              medicine or quick symptom control to avert injury. Bipolar
              disorder requires lifelong treatment. It may take months or years
              for you and your doctor to establish a thorough treatment plan
              that works. Despite this setback, treatment must continue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mania and despair often return. Bipolar disorder patients rarely
              exhibit mood swings between episodes, but some may. Chronic
              treatment can alleviate these symptoms. Best bipolar disorder
              clinic in Texas is Premier Pain Centers. Having bipolar disorder,
              in addition to anxiety or ADHD, can complicate therapy. For OCD
              and ADHD, which exacerbates bipolar disorder symptoms or induces a
              manic episode,{" "}

              might give antidepressants and stimulants. Again, treating these
              illnesses is tough but achievable. Maintain your commitment to
              discovering a treatment strategy that works.
