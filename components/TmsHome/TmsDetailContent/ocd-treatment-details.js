            <h2>What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?</h2>
            <p>
              Obsessive-compulsive disorder therapy is characterized by repeated
              undesirable thoughts and sensations that lead to repetitive
              activities. Repetitive behaviours might hinder socializing and
              daily work. OCD is usually chronic, but symptoms can fluctuate.
              Obsessions and compulsions affect everyone. Sometimes, people
              double-check the stove or locks. In regular conversations, people
              use “obsessing” and “obsessed” lightly. However, OCD is severe.
              Hours can be spent on it. It disrupts daily living. People with
              OCD dislike their obsessions and compulsive habits. Our top
              psychiatrist in Dallas can help in treatment of OCD.

              These are recurring negative ideas, urges, or visions. Try to
              ignore or avoid them, but you can't. OCD sufferers share some
              compulsive ideas. Some examples are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fear of harming yourself or others</li>
              <li>

            <p>
              Physical or mental actions you feel obligated to accomplish while
              not wanting to. They're often obsessional; you think they'll stop
              unwelcome thoughts or prevent bad things from happening.
            </p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Regularly repeating chores or adhering to strict regimens.
              </li>
              <li>
                Needing to count steps or bottles and attribute meaning to
                numbers
              </li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              OCD sufferers often avoid situations that cause obsessions. Mild
              to severe symptoms can be disabling. Time might improve or worsen
              them. You may also adjust your obsessions and habits.
