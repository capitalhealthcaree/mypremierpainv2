            <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
            <p>
              Autism affects how your child interacts with the world due to
              brain differences. Their congenital disability has nothing to do
              with your parenting style, diet, immunisations, or anything else.
              A cure for autism isn't the goal. Instead, our Best autism clinics
              in Texas help your child recognise and capitalise on their
              strengths while overcoming obstacles. Autistics are
              neurodivergent. Everyone on Earth is unique, including autistic
              children and adults. As with any other person, autistic people
              have a wide range of personality traits, abilities, and
              challenges.

            <h2>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>
            <p>
              The medical term for autism is autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
              Autism spectrum disorder is a neurological illness that impacts
              communication and relationships, according to the DSM-5-TR.
              Autistic people may not employ eye contact or body language like
              neurotypicals. A person's behaviour, hobbies, and activities are
              also affected by this brain difference. To control their emotions,
              people may “stimulate” by repeating movements or sounds. If you

            <h2>Autism Treatment: What Should We Know?</h2>
            <p>
              Autism is not a disease; thus, physicians don't “treat” it. It
              neither “goes away” nor can be “cured.” Your child's brain
              operates that way. Even if some traits change over time, they will
              always be part of their identity. However, providers do autism
              diagnosis and handle autistic symptoms that may hinder your
              child's development. Mental health services in Dallas for autism
              include a variety of therapies that teach your child lifelong
              skills like social communication.
