                <h2>What is TMS Therapy in Dallas</h2>
                <p>
                  TMS Therapy in Dallas is a noninvasive treatment for
                  depression and other mental problems; however, not everyone
                  can benefit. Due to magnetic field interference, those with
                  head implants like aneurysm clips, cochlear implants, or
                  pacemakers are usually disqualified. Since TMS increases
                  seizure risk, anyone with a history of seizures or epilepsy
                  may be ineligible. TMS may cause manic episodes in
                  uncontrolled bipolar disorder. The treatment may not work for
                  patients with severe cognitive impairment, dementia, or
                  neurological problems, including stroke or traumatic brain
                  damage. Active substance addiction, untreated severe
                  psychological problems, and unstable physiological conditions
                  can compromise TMS safety and efficacy.

                  Though pregnant women should be cautious, TMS may be
                  considered under close monitoring. Due to the sessions, folks
                  who can't sit still or follow directions may not be good
                  candidates. Before TMS, a thorough medical and psychological
                  examination is needed. If TMS is not suitable, pharmaceutical
                  adjustments, counselling, ECT, or ketamine therapy could be
                  attempted depending on the needs of the patient.
