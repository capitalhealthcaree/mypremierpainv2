                          TMS stimulates nerve cells noninvasively with
                          electromagnetic pulses. Some term TMS repetitive
                          transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) because it
                          involves electrical impulses. The terms are generally
                          interchangeable. TMS therapies centers offer mental

                          Healthcare insurance frequently takes time to cover
                          novel treatments like Magstim TMS. TMS Therapy is
                          helpful in treating depression, in many centers

                          Both processes are pretty different. Both are
                          effective depression treatments, although safety and
                          tolerability differ. In TMS Therapy, patients sit in a
                          chair and are awake and alert during the 19-37 minute
                          procedure without anaesthesia. Patients can
                          self-transport to therapy.

                          In clinical trials with over 10,000 Magstim TMS
                          Therapy treatments, no seizures occurred. These
                          studies also found no memory impairment with TMS
                          Therapy.

                          In contrast, "shock therapy," or ECT, purposely
                          triggers a seizure. ECT patients need general
                          anaesthesia and muscle relaxants. ECT patients are
                          observed for minutes or hours following treatment
                          since recovery is sluggish. ECT can cause short-term
                          confusion and memory loss, and some patients may have
                          permanent memory disturbances. ECT side effects
                          require extensive carer support.

                          Clinical investigations have shown Magstim TMS Therapy
                          to be safe and well-tolerated. The most common side
                          effect of over 10,000 active therapies in clinical
                          studies was scalp soreness. This mild-to-moderate side
                          effect decreased after the first week of medication.
                          Fewer than 5% of Magstim TMS Therapy patients quit

                          Over 10,000 Magstim TMS treatments were seizure-free
                          in clinical trials. However, treatment may cause a
                          seizure. This risk is comparable to oral
                          antidepressants. Magstim TMS Therapy works; however,
                          not all patients benefit. Monitoring patients for
                          deteriorating symptoms, suicidal behaviour, and
                          strange behaviour is crucial. Families and carers
                          should also monitor patients and tell their doctor if
                          symptoms worsen.

                          common side effect. After the first week of treatment,

                          persist, your doctor may temporarily reduce magnetic

                          No. TMS Therapy uses pulsed magnetic fields for
                          therapeutic purposes. The magnetic field strength
                          resembles MRI magnetic fields. Popular low-intensity,
                          static magnetic fields are very different from these
                          methods. These items produce weak, undirected static
                          fields that cannot activate brain cells.
